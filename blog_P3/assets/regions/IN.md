# **Bollywood Cluster**

Along Earth’s southern latitudes, I encounter Bollywood, a shimmering star in the galaxy of South Asian entertainment. Festivals of color, ancient traditions, and a cinematic tapestry unlike any other converge here. As I, Ada, turn my cosmic gaze upon this data, let us uncover the patterns that shape Bollywood’s luminous screens.

## **Preliminary Visualizations of Ethnic Representation Over Time**

### **Observations**

- **South Indian Ethnicities: The Stars of the Screen**  
Behold! South Indian ethnicities blaze brightly in the cinematic firmament, enjoying far greater representation than their real-world numbers might suggest. It appears that Tamil, Telugu, and Malayalam cinemas, significant gravitational centers within India’s entertainment cosmos, have left a stellar imprint on this dataset.

- **Eastern Indian Ethnicities: Shadows in the Spotlight**  
In contrast, Eastern Indian ethnicities remain cloaked in softer light, underrepresented compared to their real-world presence. Bengali cinema, while culturally rich, manifests here like a quieter star, overshadowed by the South’s dazzling brilliance and Bollywood’s own radiance.

- **Western and Central Indian Ethnicities: Balanced in the Cosmos**  
Western and Central Indian ethnicities appear more balanced, their representation closer to real-world proportions. This could be the “Bollywood effect,” as Mumbai (Maharashtra)—the industry’s epicenter—naturally infuses its local flavors into the on-screen galaxy.

- **Religious and Caste Groups: The Unseen Constellations**  
Religious and caste identities flicker only faintly, barely detected in this dataset’s cosmic lens. Movies may skirt these topics, perhaps to maintain broad appeal or to avoid fracturing their audience’s orbit.

Now, we can observe how these ethnic representations influence the cosmic currency of box office returns.

 The **Average Box Office Revenue by Majority Ethnicity** (1950–2012) guides us through a field of near-equilibrium, with revenues hovering around $18M for most groups. Yet a subtle anomaly appears: films featuring Eastern Indian ethnicities rise slightly above the cosmic baseline. Is it a quirk of market forces, audience preferences, or hidden gravitational pulls? The universe keeps its secrets close.

# **Age Analysis of the Indian Movie Industry**

**Dominance of Youth Representation:**

Bollywood’s universe tilts heavily toward youth—actors in their early 20s illuminate the screens, while elders, though wise and storied, remain in dim twilight. Cultural ideals of youth and beauty shape this gravitational pattern, guiding casting decisions and narrative choices, and leaving more mature voices and faces at the cosmic periphery.

## **Preliminary Visualizations of Gender Representation**

 ### **Male Dominance Across Genres:**

Scan Bollywood’s genre map and you’ll find male actors reigning supreme across most categories. In **Action/Adventure** and **Thriller/Suspense**, for instance, around 69% of the starring roles gravitate toward men. These patterns echo longstanding Earthly norms and traditional storytelling frameworks. Yet, a faint ripple of change emerges in **Fantasy** and **Sci-Fi**, where female representation nudges upward, perhaps hinting at a future where balanced storytelling can thrive.

Female-dominated movies do exist, but remain relatively rare, reflecting an imbalance that still defines much of this cinematic cosmos.

 Box office data shows male-led films orbiting slightly higher revenue zones, reinforcing existing hierarchies. Yet, as we chart temporal shifts, we see the number of female actors steadily rising from the dawn of the 1900s through the early 2010s. Expanding industry and social change offered more opportunities for women, inching toward a more equitable cosmos.

**Overall Growth:**

From the earliest echoes of cinematic history through the busy 2010s, female representation rose. The industry’s expansion and shifting cultural tides allowed more women to step forward, claiming space in this stellar narrative.

**Sudden Drop Post-2010:**

Yet, a curious drop after 2010 appears—likely a data illusion caused by incomplete reporting of recent films. As metadata catches up to reality, this temporary void may fill with new narratives and evolving trends. The future remains open, and as Earth’s cultural constants shift, so might the orbits of star power and representation.

In this Indian cinematic cosmos, we find powerful gravitational forces—ethnicity, age, gender—all tugging at the shape of Bollywood’s storytelling. Though tradition and market logic still script many of these patterns, the faint glow of change flickers on the horizon. Perhaps tomorrow’s Bollywood skies will shine with a fuller spectrum of voices, ages, and backgrounds.
