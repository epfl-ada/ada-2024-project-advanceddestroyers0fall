<h2 id="-introduction-"><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>From what I could gather, East Asia is a fascinating region of Earth, home to ancient civilizations, and some of the planet&#39;s most vibrant cultures. Let’s dive in and see what the data reveals about this region!</p>
<h2 id="-ethnicity-proportion-analysis-"><strong>Ethnicity Proportion Analysis</strong></h2>
<!-- this part is where we have the visualisation for east asia of the common plot of ethnicity -->
<p><strong>. Disproportionate Representation:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Chinese populations</strong>, who make up the largest demographic in the region, are surprisingly underrepresented in certain genres and periods.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <strong>Korean</strong> and <strong>Japanese</strong> ethnicities seem to enjoy overrepresentation in the cinematic landscape, particularly in genres like Drama and Science Fiction. It appears that Earth’s storytellers in these regions lean into specific cultural identities, allowing certain groups to dominate the screen while others fade into the background.</p>
<p>To explore this further, let’s analyze the pie chart comparing real-world demographics to cinematic representation in East Asia for the period between 1996 and 2012.</p>

<p>This chart makes it crystal clear:  <strong>Koreans</strong> take the spotlight, while other groups—like Taiwanese—are either pushed to the side or almost disappear entirely.</p>

<p><em>Observations? Oh, curious minds! Let me translate the patterns your mortal eyes perceive...</em></p>
<p><strong>Chinese Cinema:</strong> Held back over time by history and political struggles. A quiet giant, waiting for its moment to shine.</p>
<p><strong>Japanese &amp; Korean Cinema:</strong> Ah, the brilliance of innovation and the magnetic pull of global fascination! Japan—first with its timeless masters, then Studio Ghibli’s ethereal brush. Korea—emerging like a comet, blazing across the cosmos, fueled by Hallyu’s undeniable force.</p>

<h2 id="-age-distribution-analysis-"><strong>Age Distribution Analysis</strong></h2>
<!-- this part is where we have the visualisation for east asia of the common plot of age -->
<p><strong>Dominance of Youth Representation:</strong></p>
<p>Across all plots, youth takes the spotlight, with ages tightly clustered in the <strong>20-40 range</strong>.
Meanwhile, the real-world populations hum with balance – age flows across all ranges, from the <em>energetic youth</em> to the <em>wise elders</em>.
But cinema? Ah, it bends toward the younger kind. A reflection of what the industry desires… and perhaps, what it believes the world wishes to see.</p>
<p><strong>Gender-Based Differences:</strong></p>
<p><em>Females:</em>
We can clearly observe that there&#39;s a Ssrong peak in the <strong>20-30 age</strong> group, diminishing significantly past 40.
This phenomenon whispers of a bias in Earth casting rituals, favoring youthful appearances, while elder females vanish from the on-screen landscape.</p>
<p><em>Males:</em>
Males ascend to their prime slightly later, peaking in the <strong>30-40 year</strong> zone.
Unlike their female counterparts, males endure longer in Earth&#39;s cinema narrative.
Let us descend deeper into this analysis by unraveling the mysteries hidden within these violin-shaped artifacts.</p>

This plot crafted for <strong>males</strong> reveals cinema&#39;s selective spotlight and Earth&#39;s natural balance.
But, traveler, do not stop here! The patterns of <strong>females</strong> await exploration as well.

<p>To confirm our findings, we probed the human knowledge archives for deeper truths.
The book <em>Women in East Asian Cinema: Gender Representations, Creative Labour and Global Histories</em> discusses the marginalization of older women in East Asian film industries. It highlights how cultural norms and industry practices contribute to the preference for younger female actors.<br>[Source: <em>Women in East Asian Cinema</em> - <a href="https://academic.oup.com/edinburgh-scholarship-online/book/58312">Oxford Academic</a>]</p>

<!-- this part is where we have the visualisation for east asia of the common plot of gender -->
<p><strong>Male Dominance Across Genres:</strong>
In all observed Earthly time streams, the energy signatures of male entities surpass those of females, particularly in the high-thrill zones of Action/Adventure and Science Fiction.
<em>1996–2012:</em> During this planetary phase, male entities dominated most genres, with their highest peak proportions of 71.0% in Action/Adventure and 67.2% in Thriller/Suspense. </p>

<p><strong>Genre-Specific Representation:</strong>
In some territories like <strong>Drama</strong>, there is a slow yet steady rise in female energy waves over time.
Meanwhile, the cosmic zones of <strong>Romance</strong> and <strong>Horror</strong> glow brighter with higher female presence.</p>

<p><strong>Real-World Comparison:</strong>
In the vast expanse of Earth&#39;s real-world population, the gender split leans approximately 55% female and 45% male—a balance most logical and natural. </p>
<p>Let us now dive deeper into the cosmic currents of gender representation by looking into the <strong>Chi-Square Test:</strong></p>
<p><em>Hypotheses</em></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Null Hypothesis (H₀)</strong>:<br>The gender proportions in East Asian cinema match the real-world population proportions (no significant difference).</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)</strong>:<br>The gender proportions in East Asian cinema differ significantly from real-world population proportions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<!-- put here maybe picture of chi squre test formula-->
<p><em>Results</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chi-Square Statistic</strong>: 14.77  </li>
<li><strong>P-Value</strong>: 0.00012  </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Interpretation</em></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Chi-Square Statistic (14.77)</strong>:<br>This measures the discrepancy between observed (cinema proportions) and expected (real-world proportions) values. It indicates a greater deviation from the expected proportions.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>P-Value (0.00012)</strong>:<br>The p-value is much smaller than the standard significance threshold (e.g., 0.05). This means the result is statistically significant.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Conclusion:</em></p>
<p><strong>Reject the Null Hypothesis (H₀)</strong>: The gender proportions in East Asian cinema are significantly different from real-world gender proportions.
Though beings classified as <em>Females</em> constitute 55% of Earth’s population, their luminous presence is dimmed and shadowed in the cinematic landscape.</p>
<p>This imbalance we observe aligns with knowledge inscribed by Earth’s thinkers.
The book <em>Women in East Asian Cinema: Gender Representations, Creative Labour and Global Histories</em>  explores how the contributions of women have been historically diminished and overlooked in these cinematic domains.</p>
