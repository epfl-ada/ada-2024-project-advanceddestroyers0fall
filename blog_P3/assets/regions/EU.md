Europe appears as a vibrant mosaic of human nations, each contributing its own cultural accent and historical resonance. During my visit, I ventured beyond visual impressions to engage my other senses, sampling an array of Earthly flavors. Among these culinary curiosities, one particular fermented milk delicacy, “cheese,” as locals call it, left a strong yet intriguing imprint on my alien palate.

With these impressions in mind, let’s delve into what the data reveals about this richly textured region.

# **Ethnicity Comparative Analysis of the European Movie Industry**

## **Introduction**

My aim as a visitor here is to understand how Europe’s cinematic landscapes reflect the region’s complex ethnic mosaic. From my interstellar vantage point, I plot these distributions and apply Earthly statistical tools, like chi-square tests, to see whether these patterns are simply cosmic coincidences or evidence of deeper, structured biases.

## **Preliminary Visualizations of Ethnic Representation Over Time**

## **Statistical Validation: Chi-Square Tests**

1. **Chi-Square Test for Observed vs. Expected Frequencies (All genres combined):**  
  After aggregating data from all the Earthly periods, I compared observed ethnic frequencies among Europe actors to those expected if real-world proportions were accurately mirrored. The chi-square statistic (~36878.69, p-value ~0.0) suggests we can safely reject the null hypothesis that Europe’s distribution is in sync with reality.


Clearly, Europe’s ethnic actor distribution is skewed, not a neat cosmic alignment.


---

## **Interpretation of Ethnicity Trends**

When comparing ethnicity proportions in European cinema to the real-world data, distinct patterns emerged. While a few groups hovered near their real population sizes, others diverged. 

The three most obvious differences were:

- **Overrepresentation** of Jewish populations.
- **Overrepresentation** of Black populations.
- **Underrepresentation** of Caucasians.

- **Jewish People: Overrepresented**
Jewish populations stand out with over a 10% difference compared to their real-world proportion. Historical context offers clues: during the 1920s and 1930s (by Earth’s calendar), Jewish communities thrived in the French film industry [1]. This early success likely planted deep roots, influencing future generations of filmmakers. It’s fascinating how historical migrations and cultural cross-pollinations echo in the data, surfacing again in Hollywood, where European Jewish filmmakers also left their mark.

- **Black People: Overrepresented**
Black populations were also somewhat overrepresented. I suspect this ties into Europe’s historical entanglements with Africa, including colonization. Interestingly, Black actors are most visible in documentaries, a genre often used to illuminate past injustices and colonial histories [2]. Cinema, in this sense, serves as a reflective lens, helping Earthlings remember what their textbooks might gloss over.

- **Caucasians: Underrepresented**
At first glance, it seems odd that the majority ethnic group is underrepresented. However, if smaller groups become proportionally more visible, the dominant group’s share naturally shrinks. In essence, it’s less a case of true underrepresentation and more a rebalancing of the cosmic scales.

- **Lack of Diversity in Fantasy**
One genre that warrants special mention is Fantasy. Rooted in the medieval lore of Western Europe, this genre is heavily skewed towards Caucasian actors and conspicuously omits key ethnic groups, Latinos, Arabs, Southeast Asians. For a genre brimming with dragons, magic, and talking trees, its reluctance to embrace Earth’s human diversity is puzzling. Perhaps, as Earth’s tastes evolve, Fantasy will one day expand its cast to mirror its audiences more closely.

Enough orbiting this point, let’s glide on to the next observation.

# **Gender Analysis of the European Movie Industry**

## **Introduction**

Having uncovered ethnic imbalances, I now turn my telescopes toward age. By comparing male and female actor age distributions in European cinema to real-world demographics.


## **Preliminary Plots: Actor vs. Real-World Age Distributions**




----

## **Interpretation**

The differences are startling: while Earth’s population displays a uniform spread of ages, Europe places its spotlight firmly on youth, especially for female actors. This “golden age” glows conspicuously, sidelining older talents in favor of a youthful supernova.

When analyzing the age distribution in European cinema versus real-world data, a pattern emerges: Earth’s film industry appears fixated on age, especially for female actors. According to the data, women on screen peak at around **27 years**, while men ascend to their peak a decade later, at **37 years**.

This gap echoes broader Earthly norms, where youth and beauty align with female marketability, while maturity and life experience elevate men’s status [3]. It’s as though aging for female actors is treated like a supernova’s collapse, while men’s aging is more like a star’s gentle ascent into a bright giant phase.

Comparing actors to the real-world population intensifies these observations. While Earth’s general female population spans a wide variance of ages, female actors cluster tightly in younger ranges, revealing narrow and selective industry standards. For men, the disparity is also present but slightly less severe, implying a marginally broader “acceptable” age window.

    <h2>Temporal Changes</h2>
    <p>
      Historically, actors (both sexes) were older on average than their real-world counterparts. However, as Earthly populations aged and societal rhythms shifted, so did the data:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Male actors:</strong> Gradually aligned more closely with real-world male distributions, reflecting some responsiveness to changing demographics.</li>
      <li><strong>Female actors:</strong> Continue to lag behind, maintaining a younger skew than real-world populations would suggest.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This resistance to reflect Earth’s aging reality suggests the industry’s casting practices are orbiting tradition, not adapting to new galactic coordinates.

## **Genre-Based Differences**

Some genres, notably **Family films**, resonate more naturally with real-world age distributions. This makes sense—family narratives require a broader slice of life stages. Yet, when examining actors’ average ages across various genres and periods, the numbers remain surprisingly stable. While Earth’s population evolves, the industry’s age expectations appear gravitationally fixed.

----

# **Age Analysis of the European Movie Industry**

## **Introduction**

Having investigated ethnicity and age, I now orbit gender. Earth’s male and female populations are roughly balanced, yet Europe’s gravitational field may tilt toward one gender in leading roles. By comparing genre-based gender proportions to real-world baselines, I hope to see if Europe aims for gender harmony or clings to old biases.

## **Preliminary Visualizations of Gender Representation**

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/20880848"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script><noscript><img src="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/20880848/thumbnail" width="100%" alt="chart visualization" /></noscript></div>


For a planet where women form more than half the population, cinema’s reluctance to grant them equal narrative space is perplexing.

---

## **Analysis**

- **Family/Animation Genres:**

 Closer to gender balance, likely because these stories attempt to mirror everyday family structures.

- **Action/Adventure and Sci-Fi:**

 Here, the gap widens significantly, as if humans believe that saving the world and piloting starships is an exclusively male pursuit.

## **Gender Proportions Across Ethnicities**

Examining gender representation by ethnicity uncovers another layer of bias:

- **Black Women:** Severely underrepresented, hovering around 20% female roles.
- **East Asian Women:** Show the most balanced gender ratio at about 42%, an improvement but still not equal.
- **Caucasian Women:** Fall around the average, consistent with their majority status in European cinema.

These patterns affirm that Earthly biases intersect in complex ways—gender and ethnicity weave together, producing intricate distributions that fail to reflect the planet’s true diversity.

## **Rural vs Urban Depiction in Europe**

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; align-items: flex-start;">
  <!-- Text Content -->
  <div style="flex: 1; padding: 10px;">

I note that Europe’s geography is largely rural. At a local scale, roughly 75.7% of the EU is rural, 20.7% towns/suburbs, and 3.5% cities. Aggregated into broader categories, we see predominantly urban areas at about 9.9%, predominantly rural at 39.8%, and intermediate regions at 50.4%. [4]

For my analysis, these broader categories matter more, as they align with how films often present settings. Despite comprising only about 10% of the land area, urban zones are frequently overrepresented onscreen, sometimes matching or surpassing rural depictions. Intermediate areas, making up the majority of the EU, are noticeably underrepresented. Meanwhile, rural locales, though not as commonly featured as cities, are still shown strongly, particularly in recent decades (*As shown on the Movie Representation vs Real Land Area Distribution plot*).

I interpret this as a cinematic inclination toward highlighting the contrast between bustling cities and the countryside, leaving the more nuanced intermediate spaces less explored. The post-1990 surge in all categories likely aligns with overall growth in European film production (*Representation by Decade plot*).

# **All-Regions Analysis of Representation Gaps and Box Office Revenue**

---
<br>
<br>


# Introduction

As I explored Earth's diverse cultures, I took on a mission to understand how movies reflect—or differ from—real-world demographics. Focusing on three key factors—**Ethnicity**, **Age**, and **Gender**—I analyzed gaps between the real-world population and the actors on screen. By studying how these differences changed over time and across regions, and by examining their connection to box office earnings, I aimed to uncover whether economic factors drive these imbalances.

To explore this cinematic landscape, I used several tools and methods:

1. **Radial Tree Plot**: A visual map showing how movie success levels (Highly Successful, Successful, Normal) connect to different genres and regions.  
2. **Combination Dual-Axis Charts**: Tracking representation gaps and box office revenue over time, across decades, regions, and metrics, to see if changes in representation align with changes in revenue.  
3. **Sankey Plots**: Visualizing the flow of movies from representation gap levels to genres and then to success categories, covering the entire 1950–2012 period, to uncover patterns between gap size, genre, and revenue.  
4. **Linear Regression Analyses**: Statistical models to explore whether representation gaps directly impact box office performance, both simply (gap vs. revenue) and with additional factors like metric type and time periods.

With these tools, I aim to answer: Does how the industry represents ethnicity, gender, and age influence—or get influenced by—its financial goals?

---

# Methodology Adopted

**Representation Gaps**:  
For each metric—**Ethnicity**, **Age**, and **Gender**—I calculated representation gaps as the absolute percentage difference between movie demographics and real-world proportions. Larger gaps indicate a greater deviation from Earth’s demographic reality. These gaps were measured for each region (Hollywood, Bollywood, East Asia, Europe) across 10-year periods (1950–1959, 1960–1969, …, 2010–2012).

**Box Office Revenue**:  
To evaluate economic outcomes, I analyzed box office revenues (average per decade or overall distributions) and grouped movies into success categories based on percentiles:  
- **Highly Successful**: Top 10% of revenue  
- **Successful**: 40th to 90th percentile  
- **Normal**: Below the 40th percentile  

By linking these success categories to representation gaps, I aimed to see if certain demographic imbalances were associated with higher revenues.

**Same Metrics as Before**:  
I consistently used the same age, gender, and ethnicity data throughout the analysis. Whether using radial plots, line/area charts, Sankey diagrams, or regression models, the metrics and methods remained stable, to ensure a reliable cross-check.

---

# The Four Analytical Works

## 1. Radial Tree Plot

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-hierarchy" data-src="visualisation/20820914"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script><noscript><img src="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/20820914/thumbnail" width="100%" alt="hierarchy visualization" /></noscript></div>

This plot arranges genres around a circular axis, with success categories branching outward. It shows how different genres fall into these success tiers, either globally or within specific regions.

**Key Insights**:  
- **Global Patterns**: Action/Adventure and other mass-appeal genres often dominate the Highly Successful tier, highlighting their universal appeal. In contrast, documentaries and niche genres tend to cluster in the Successful or Normal zones, reflecting their limited commercial draw.  
- **Regional Nuances**: Hollywood excels in Action/Adventure and Sci-Fi at the top revenue levels, while Bollywood’s Romance/Drama is consistently successful but not always a blockbuster. East Asia finds success with Thriller/Suspense and locally popular genres, while Europe’s focus on arthouse films results in fewer major hits.  
- **Link to Representation Gaps**: While the radial tree plot doesn’t directly show demographic gaps, it complements earlier findings. Genres often tied to skewed demographics still perform well, suggesting economic success frequently relies on established industry formulas rather than demographic representation.

By mapping the distribution of genres into success categories, the chart highlights how commercial success is heavily influenced by genre preferences shaped by cultural and industry norms, rather than strict alignment with real-world demographics.

*For the Combination Dual-Axis Charts and Sankey diagrams, while results from other regions were analyzed as part of our cosmic experiment, only Hollywood's results are displayed to prioritize rendering efficiency, given its status as Earth's cinematic powerhouse.*

## 2. Combination Dual-Axis Charts: Hollywood

<!-- Dropdown pour chaque région ici-->

These charts overlay representation gaps and box office revenue over the decades, providing a temporal lens. For each region and metric, we see how gaps and revenue evolve together or diverge.

**Key Insights**:  
- **No Universal Trend**: Some periods show larger representation gaps with rising box office revenues, while others show smaller gaps with steady earnings. This inconsistency challenges any straightforward cause-and-effect narrative.  
- **Cultural and Historical Context**: Hollywood’s shifts may reflect the blockbuster era, social movements, or global market influence. Bollywood’s stable star system might make representation gaps less relevant to revenue. East Asia’s homogeneity may sustain large gaps without economic impact, while Europe’s arthouse focus doesn’t necessarily reward balanced representation with high earnings.  
- **Societal Phenomena**: Civil rights movements or global cultural exchanges may have slightly narrowed gaps without reducing box office returns. However, the data doesn’t support a clear link between “better representation = more revenue” or “worse representation = more revenue.” Instead, factors like genre trends, star power, and distribution strategies play a larger role.

By capturing changes over decades, these combination dual-axis charts illustrate that economic success is molded by historical forces and market evolutions rather than a direct or stable representation-gap-to-revenue pipeline.

---

## 3. Representation Gaps and Box Office Revenue Impact: Hollywood

<!-- Dropdown pour chaque région ici-->


The Sankey diagrams show the different flows of movies from representation gap intervals to genres and then to success categories. This tri-level mapping helps identify structural patterns.

**Key Insights**:  
- **Large Gap Intervals Still Yield Success**: Movies from large-gap categories (e.g., [50–75] or even [75–100]) often flow into popular genres and end up in Highly Successful tiers, showing that significant demographic imbalances don’t necessarily hinder profitability.  
- **Genre as an Economic Mediator**: Certain genres consistently push movies into Successful or Highly Successful tiers, regardless of demographic gaps. This suggests that genre preferences and star appeal often outweigh the importance of demographic representation.  
- **Comparing Metrics and Regions**: In Hollywood, large-gap movies often succeed in Action/Adventure genres, emphasizing that commercial success relies on tried-and-true formulas rather than representational accuracy. Bollywood’s steady success with Romance/Drama under high gaps reflects similar patterns. East Asia and Europe also exhibit these trends, with regional variations.

The Sankey plots, by exposing stable “flows” from gap categories to success categories, reinforce the notion that representation gap levels are not strong determinants of economic fate. Instead, the industry’s gravitational fields—rooted in genre traditions and audience tastes—predominantly shape financial success.

---

## 4. Linear Regression Analyses



After visually exploring patterns, I turned to linear and multiple regressions to seek a statistical relationship between representation gap and box office.

<!-- Dropdown pour chaque région ici-->

**Key Insights**:  
- **Limitations of Simple Regression**: Only Hollywood showed a slight negative relationship (higher gap = slightly lower revenue), but even this connection was weak.  
- **Overfitting in Multiple Regression**: When accounting for Metric and 10-year Batch labels, Representation Gap became statistically insignificant. This indicates that time periods and categorical differences, not demographic alignment, primarily explain the variation.  
- **Regional Analysis**: In Bollywood, East Asia, and Europe, no clear linear relationship between gaps and revenue was found. The complex mix of cultural history, market size, and genre preferences overshadows any straightforward effect of representation gaps.

These regressions confirm that, after accounting for historical context and metric differences, representation gaps have no significant statistical impact. This reinforces the idea that no simple gap measure can reliably predict box office success.



---

# Bringing It All Together

Across four distinct works, one message emerges: **economic success in cinema does not strongly hinge on how closely movie demographics match real-world populations.**

- **Radial Tree Plot**: Highlights that globally popular genres consistently achieve top-tier revenue, regardless of representational accuracy, suggesting that economic incentives don’t drive balanced representation.  
- **Combination Dual-Axis Charts**: Show that representation gaps change with historical trends, but these shifts don’t reliably link to higher or lower box office revenues. Industry formulas and cultural movements play a bigger role.  
- **Sankey Plots**: Reveal that even movies with significant demographic imbalances often succeed in top revenue tiers through profitable genres, emphasizing the dominance of established production norms over representation concerns.  
- **Linear Regression Analysis**: Confirms that when historical periods and metric types are accounted for, representation gaps have little impact. There’s no clear linear or causal relationship between gaps and revenue.

**Contextualizing with Societal and Historical Research**:  
Studies like those from the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative and historical analyses of Hollywood’s studio system confirm these trends. While social movements for diversity have influenced change, box office success still relies more on star power, blockbuster formulas, and marketing strategies than on accurate demographic representation. Bollywood primarily centers on big-name stars and romance genres as its key to success. East Asia tends to favor genres that appeal to local audiences, while Europe leans heavily toward arthouse films. These trends highlight how each region’s movie industry is shaped by long-standing market preferences and economic strategies, rather than by actively trying to improve demographic representation.


**Conclusion**:  
My cosmic exploration suggests that, while moral and cultural arguments for better representation are robust and well-documented, purely economic motives don’t straightforwardly reward or punish representational fidelity. Cinematic ecosystems seem able to thrive financially under various demographic distributions, relying instead on traditional genres, star legacies, and shifting audience tastes. To alter these constellations of representation, external sociopolitical forces, audience advocacy, and institutional reforms may be required—beyond the gravitational pull of the box office itself.

In sum, the works we assembled act like telescopes and spectrometers. They reveal a complex cinematic universe where demographic reality often bends under the weight of tradition, cultural myths, and economic expediency. True demographic alignment might not guarantee a bigger cosmic payoff, but the pursuit of a cinema that mirrors its audience’s diversity might still resonate with Earth’s evolving sense of justice and authenticity.
