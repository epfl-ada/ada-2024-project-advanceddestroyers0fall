# **Europe Cluster**

From my vantage point as an interstellar traveler, Europe appears as a vibrant mosaic of human nations, each contributing its own cultural accent and historical resonance. During my visit, I ventured beyond visual impressions to engage my other senses, sampling an array of Earthly flavors. Among these culinary curiosities, one particular fermented milk delicacy, “cheese,” as locals call it, left a strong yet intriguing imprint on my alien palate.

With these impressions in mind, let’s delve into what the data reveals about this richly textured region.

# **Ethnicity Comparative Analysis of the Hollywood Movie Industry**

## **Introduction**

My aim as a visitor here is to understand how Europe’s cinematic landscapes reflect the region’s complex ethnic mosaic. From my interstellar vantage point, I plot these distributions and apply Earthly statistical tools, like chi-square tests, to see whether these patterns are simply cosmic coincidences or evidence of deeper, structured biases.

## **Statistical Validation: Chi-Square Tests**

1. **Chi-Square Test for Observed vs. Expected Frequencies (All genres combined):**  
  After aggregating data from all the Earthly periods, I compared observed ethnic frequencies among Europe actors to those expected if real-world proportions were accurately mirrored. The chi-square statistic (~36878.69, p-value ~0.0) suggests we can safely reject the null hypothesis that Europe’s distribution is in sync with reality.


Clearly, Europe’s ethnic actor distribution is skewed, not a neat cosmic alignment.




---

## **Interpretation of Ethnicity Trends**

When comparing ethnicity proportions in European cinema to the real-world data, distinct patterns emerged. While a few groups hovered near their real population sizes, others diverged. 

The three most striking trends were:

- **Overrepresentation** of Jewish populations.
- **Overrepresentation** of Black populations.
- **Underrepresentation** of Caucasians.

Let’s explore these findings more closely!

- **Jewish People: Overrepresented**
Jewish populations stand out with over a 10% difference compared to their real-world proportion. Historical context offers clues: during the 1920s and 1930s (by Earth’s calendar), Jewish communities thrived in the French film industry [[1]]. This early success likely planted deep roots, influencing future generations of filmmakers. It’s fascinating how historical migrations and cultural cross-pollinations echo in the data, surfacing again in Hollywood, where European Jewish filmmakers also left their mark.

- **Black People: Overrepresented**
Black populations were also somewhat overrepresented. I suspect this ties into Europe’s historical entanglements with Africa, including colonization. Interestingly, Black actors are most visible in documentaries, a genre often used to illuminate past injustices and colonial histories [[2]]. Cinema, in this sense, serves as a reflective lens, helping Earthlings remember what their textbooks might gloss over.

- **Caucasians: Underrepresented**
At first glance, it seems odd that the majority ethnic group is underrepresented. However, if smaller groups become proportionally more visible, the dominant group’s share naturally shrinks. In essence, it’s less a case of true underrepresentation and more a rebalancing of the cosmic scales.

- **Lack of Diversity in Fantasy**
One genre that warrants special mention is Fantasy. Rooted in the medieval lore of Western Europe, this genre is heavily skewed towards Caucasian actors and conspicuously omits key ethnic groups, Latinos, Arabs, Southeast Asians. For a genre brimming with dragons, magic, and talking trees, its reluctance to embrace Earth’s human diversity is puzzling. Perhaps, as Earth’s tastes evolve, Fantasy will one day expand its cast to mirror its audiences more closely.

Enough orbiting this point, let’s glide on to the next observation.

## **Introduction**

Having uncovered ethnic imbalances, I now turn my telescopes toward age. By comparing male and female actor age distributions in European cinema to real-world demographics.

---

## **Preliminary Plots: Actor vs. Real-World Age Distributions**


----

## **Interpretation**

The differences are startling: while Earth’s population displays a uniform spread of ages, Europe places its spotlight firmly on youth, especially for female actors. This “golden age” glows conspicuously, sidelining older talents in favor of a youthful supernova.

When analyzing the age distribution in European cinema versus real-world data, a pattern emerges: Earth’s film industry appears fixated on age, especially for female actors. According to the data, women on screen peak at around **27 years**, while men ascend to their peak a decade later, at **37 years**.

This gap echoes broader Earthly norms, where youth and beauty align with female marketability, while maturity and life experience elevate men’s status [[3]]. It’s as though aging for female actors is treated like a supernova’s collapse, while men’s aging is more like a star’s gentle ascent into a bright giant phase.

Comparing actors to the real-world population intensifies these observations. While Earth’s general female population spans a wide variance of ages, female actors cluster tightly in younger ranges, revealing narrow and selective industry standards. For men, the disparity is also present but slightly less severe, implying a marginally broader “acceptable” age window.

## **Temporal changes**

Historically, actors (both sexes) were older on average than their real-world counterparts. However, as Earthly populations aged and societal rhythms shifted, so did the data:

- **Male actors** have gradually aligned more closely with real-world male distributions, reflecting some responsiveness to changing demographics.
- **Female actors**, however, continue to lag behind, maintaining a younger skew than real-world populations would suggest.
This resistance to reflect Earth’s aging reality suggests the industry’s casting practices are orbiting tradition, not adapting to new galactic coordinates.

## **Genre-Based Differences**

Some genres, notably **Family films**, resonate more naturally with real-world age distributions. This makes sense—family narratives require a broader slice of life stages. Yet, when examining actors’ average ages across various genres and periods, the numbers remain surprisingly stable. While Earth’s population evolves, the industry’s age expectations appear gravitationally fixed.

----

# **Age Analysis of the European Movie Industry**

## **Introduction**

Having investigated ethnicity and age, I now orbit gender. Earth’s male and female populations are roughly balanced, yet Europe’s gravitational field may tilt toward one gender in leading roles. By comparing genre-based gender proportions to real-world baselines, I hope to see if Europe aims for gender harmony or clings to old biases.

## **Preliminary Visualizations of Gender Representation**

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/20880848"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script><noscript><img src="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/20880848/thumbnail" width="100%" alt="chart visualization" /></noscript></div>

For a planet where women form more than half the population, cinema’s reluctance to grant them equal narrative space is perplexing.

---

## **Analysis**

- **Family/Animation Genres:**

 Closer to gender balance, likely because these stories attempt to mirror everyday family structures.

- **Action/Adventure and Sci-Fi:**

 Here, the gap widens significantly, as if humans believe that saving the world and piloting starships is an exclusively male pursuit.

## **Gender Proportions Across Ethnicities**

Examining gender representation by ethnicity uncovers another layer of bias:

- **Black Women:** Severely underrepresented, hovering around 20% female roles.
- **East Asian Women:** Show the most balanced gender ratio at about 42%, an improvement but still not equal.
- **Caucasian Women:** Fall around the average, consistent with their majority status in European cinema.

These patterns affirm that Earthly biases intersect in complex ways—gender and ethnicity weave together, producing intricate distributions that fail to reflect the planet’s true diversity.

# Integrated Analysis of Cinematic Representation Gaps and Box Office Revenue

---

# Introduction

As I drifted among Earth’s cultural constellations, I ventured into a grand endeavor: to understand how the movies Earthlings cherish align—or misalign—with the demographic patterns of your own reality. Anchored in three key metrics—**Ethnicity**, **Age**, and **Gender**—I sought to quantify representation gaps between real-world populations and the actors who grace Earthlings' screens. By examining how these discrepancies evolved through time and across regions, and by linking them to the gravitational pull of box office revenue, I hoped to uncover whether economic currents encourage such imbalances.

To explore this cinematic cosmos, I employed multiple observational instruments and analytical methods:

1. **Radial Tree Plot**: A visual galaxy mapping how movie success categories (Highly Successful, Successful, Normal) link to various genres and regions.  
2. **Combination Dual-Axis Charts**: Temporal journeys tracking representation gaps and box office revenue across decades, regions, and metrics. These help us see if changes in gaps mirror changes in revenue.  
3. **Sankey Plots**: Flows of movies from representation gap intervals to genres and ultimately to success categories, aggregated over the entire 1950–2012 period. These highlight structural associations between gap magnitude, genre choice, and final revenue outcomes.  
4. **Linear Regression Analyses**: Statistical attempts to measure a direct relationship between representation gaps and box office performance, both in simple forms (just gap vs. revenue) and more complex forms (controlling for metric type and temporal batches).

Armed with these tools, I can piece together a narrative: Does the industry’s portrayal of different ethnicities, genders, and ages shape—or is shaped by—its economic incentives?

---

# Methodology Adopted

**Representation Gaps**:  
For each metric (Ethnicity, Age, Gender), I computed representation gaps as absolute percentage differences between the movie populations and the corresponding real-world demographic proportions. The larger the gap, the further the industry strayed from mirroring Earth’s demographic reality. These gaps were calculated for each region (Hollywood, Bollywood, East Asia, Europe), across multiple 10-year time batches (1950–1959, 1960–1969, …, 2010–2012).

**Box Office Revenue**:  
To assess economic outcomes, I examined aggregated box office revenues (mean per batch or overall distributions) and categorized movies into percentile-based success categories:  
- **Highly Successful**: Top 10% by revenue  
- **Successful**: 40th to 90th percentile  
- **Normal**: Below the 40th percentile

By pairing these success categories with representation gaps, I hoped to see if achieving higher revenues demanded certain demographic imbalances.

**Same Metrics as Before**:  
I consistently used the same age, gender, and ethnicity data, ensuring coherence with previous analyses. Through all these steps—radial plots, line/area charts, Sankey diagrams, and regressions—the fundamental metrics and methods remained stable, allowing a comprehensive cross-check.

---

# The Four Analytical Works

## 1. Radial Tree Plot

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-hierarchy" data-src="visualisation/20820914"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script><noscript><img src="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/20820914/thumbnail" width="100%" alt="hierarchy visualization" /></noscript></div>

This plot arranges genres around a circular axis, with success categories branching outward. Across all regions or within each one, we see how different genres populate these success tiers.

**Key Insights**:  
- **Global Patterns**: Action/Adventure and mass-appeal genres often cluster in Highly Successful tiers, indicating that big-budget spectacle transcends cultural borders. Documentaries and more niche genres hover in the Successful or Normal zones, mirroring their limited commercial appeal.  
- **Regional Nuances**: Hollywood’s penchant for Action/Adventure and Sci-Fi dominates the top revenue stratum, Bollywood’s Romance/Drama tradition finds consistent but not always top-tier success, East Asia’s Thriller/Suspense or locally favored genres anchor their success tiers, and Europe’s arthouse tilt shows fewer blockbuster hits.  
- **Link to Representation Gaps**: Although the radial tree plot does not directly show demographic gaps, it complements previous findings. Genres historically associated with skewed demographics still rank highly, suggesting that economic success often aligns with entrenched formulas, regardless of representational parity.

By showing the final distribution of genres into success categories, the radial chart reveals that commercial viability is often genre-driven and shaped by longstanding cultural and industrial norms—not necessarily by aligning closely with real-world demographics.

  </div>

</div>



These charts overlay representation gaps and box office revenue over the decades, providing a temporal lens. For each region and metric, we see how gaps and revenue evolve together or diverge.

**Key Insights**:  
- **No Universal Trend**: Some periods show growing representation gaps alongside rising box office, others show shrinking gaps paired with stable revenue. This variation undermines any simple causal narrative.  
- **Cultural and Historical Context**: Hollywood’s shifts might reflect the blockbuster era, the influence of social movements, or global expansion. Bollywood’s stable star system could make representation gaps economically irrelevant. East Asia’s homogeneity might keep high gaps stable without penalty. Europe’s arthouse markets don’t necessarily reward more balanced demographics with big commercial wins.  
- **Societal Phenomena**: Periods of civil rights activism or global cultural exchange might nudge representation toward slightly narrower gaps without harming box office returns. Nonetheless, the data shows no strong pattern of “more representative = more revenue” or “less representative = more revenue.” Instead, genre cycles, star vehicles, and distribution networks overshadow demographic fine-tuning.

By capturing changes over decades, these combination dual-axis charts illustrate that economic success is molded by historical forces and market evolutions rather than a direct or stable representation-gap-to-revenue pipeline.

The Sankey diagrams show the different flows of movies from representation gap intervals to genres and then to success categories. This tri-level mapping helps identify structural patterns.

**Key Insights**:  
- **Large Gap Intervals Still Yield Success**: If flows from high-gap categories ([50,75] or even [75,100]) lead into popular genres and ultimately into Highly Successful categories, it implies that entrenched demographic imbalances did not prevent lucrative outcomes.  
- **Genre as an Economic Mediator**: Some genres consistently channel movies into Successful or even Highly Successful tiers, regardless of gap size. This supports the idea that genre preferences and star power might be more influential than demographic realism.  
- **Comparing Metrics and Regions**: In Hollywood, large-gap intervals feeding into Action/Adventure and then into Highly Successful categories confirm that commercial formulas, not representational accuracy, often drive profit. Bollywood’s stable success of Romance/Drama under large gaps indicates similarly entrenched formulas. East Asia and Europe show analogous patterns, each with their local twists.

The Sankey plots, by exposing stable “flows” from gap categories to success categories, reinforce the notion that representation gap levels are not strong determinants of economic fate. Instead, the industry’s gravitational fields—rooted in genre traditions and audience tastes—predominantly shape financial success.

---

## 4. Linear Regression Analyses



After visually exploring patterns, I turned to linear and multiple regressions to seek a statistical relationship between representation gap and box office.

<!-- Dropdown pour chaque région ici-->

<iframe src="/assets/plots/box-office/regression_plot_Hollywood.html" width="100%" height="400px" style="border:none;"></iframe>

**Key Insights**:  
- **Simple Regression Weakness**: Only Hollywood’s simple regression suggested a modest negative relationship (higher gap = slightly lower revenue), but even that was weak.  
- **Multiple Regression Overfitting**: Controlling for Metric and 10-year Batch labels explained all variation, leaving Representation Gap insignificant. This implies time and categorical differences, not demographic alignment, dominate the statistical landscape.  
- **Across Regions**: Bollywood, East Asia, and Europe showed no meaningful linear association between gap and revenue. The complex interplay of cultural history, market size, and genre preference overwhelms any direct linear effect of representation gaps.

These regressions confirm that once we factor in historical context (time periods) and differing metrics (ethnicity, age, gender), representation gap ceases to matter statistically. This supports the broader narrative: no simple numeric gap measure can predict box office returns reliably.

# Bringing It All Together

Across four distinct works, one message emerges: **economic success in cinema does not strongly hinge on how closely movie demographics match real-world populations.**

- **Radial Tree Plot**: Shows that globally favored genres secure top-tier revenue regardless of representational fidelity, hinting that economic incentives didn’t enforce representational balance.  
- **Combination Dual-Axis Charts**: Demonstrate that representation gaps fluctuate with historical forces, yet these fluctuations do not consistently correlate with higher or lower box office revenues. The industry’s formulas and cultural shifts matter more.  
- **Sankey Plots**: Aggregated flows reveal that even large demographic imbalances often feed into highly successful tiers via certain lucrative genres, reinforcing the idea that entrenched production norms hold sway over economic outcomes.  
- **Linear Regression Analysis**: Statistically confirms that once historical eras and metric categories are considered, representation gap loses explanatory power. No straightforward causal or linear link emerges between gap and revenue.

**Contextualizing with Societal and Historical Research**:  
Earth's real-world scholarship, from the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative’s studies on representation to historical accounts of Hollywood’s studio system, corroborate these patterns. Social movements for diversity have nudged changes, but the box office bottom line seems driven more by star systems, blockbuster formulas, and marketing prowess than by demographic accuracy. Bollywood’s reliance on established stars and romance genres, East Asia’s local genre preferences, and Europe’s arthouse identity all reflect entrenched market conditions rather than demographic rectifications.

**Conclusion**:  
My cosmic exploration suggests that, while moral and cultural arguments for better representation are robust and well-documented, purely economic motives don’t straightforwardly reward or punish representational fidelity. Cinematic ecosystems seem able to thrive financially under various demographic distributions, relying instead on traditional genres, star legacies, and shifting audience tastes. To alter these constellations of representation, external sociopolitical forces, audience advocacy, and institutional reforms may be required—beyond the gravitational pull of the box office itself.

In sum, the works we assembled act like telescopes and spectrometers. They reveal a complex cinematic universe where demographic reality often bends under the weight of tradition, cultural myths, and economic expediency. True demographic alignment might not guarantee a bigger cosmic payoff, but the pursuit of a cinema that mirrors its audience’s diversity might still resonate with Earth’s evolving sense of justice and authenticity.
