# **East Asian Cluster**

From my cosmic vantage point, East Asia shimmers as a constellation of ancient civilizations and vibrant cultures. Yet as I peer closer, its cinematic landscapes seem to bend and refract, revealing patterns both illuminated and obscured. Let’s drift inward and discover what the data unveils about this region.

# **Ethnicity Comparative Analysis of the East Asian Movie Industry**

## **Introduction**

My aim here is to decode how East Asia’s vibrant cinematic mosaic reflects the region's intricate ethnic tapestry. From my cosmic perch, I chart these distributions to determine whether these patterns are mere cosmic dust or reveal deeper, gravitational biases molding the images on screen.

## **Preliminary Visualizations of Ethnic Representation Over Time**

**Disproportionate Representation:**

Gazing through these earthly lenses, I find that **Chinese populations**, despite forming the largest demographic, remain curiously overshadowed in certain cinematic genres and eras. It’s as if their stellar mass fails to bend the narrative light, leaving them dimmer than one might expect.

In contrast, **Korean** and **Japanese** ethnicities shine brighter, overrepresented in genres like Drama and Science Fiction. Earth’s storytellers here seem drawn to specific cultural identities, allowing these groups to bask in the cinematic glow, while others recede into the cosmic background.

To see this phenomenon more vividly, let’s inspect the pie chart comparing real-world demographics to East Asia’s on-screen universe from 1996 to 2012.

Within this visual cosmos, **Koreans** occupy a brilliant spotlight, leaving other groups—like Taiwanese—barely visible, as if their luminescence can’t pierce cinema’s prevailing gravitational fields.

**Temporal Trends in East Asian Cinema Representation (Period: 1950–2012)**

Temporal data reveals peculiar fluctuations across the decades—shifts seemingly influenced by the surges and ebbs in this planet’s own historical narrative. Let’s journey through time and watch how these patterns realign under evolving cultural constellations.

1. **Golden Age of Japanese Cinema (1950–1965)**
Japan’s cinematic brilliance shone like a supernova—Kurosawa, Ozu, Mizoguchi—names that anchored the industry’s celestial map. Post-war resilience and profound storytelling gave rise to a strong ethnic presence.

2. **Rise of Martial Arts Films (1966–1980)**
Martial arts films from Hong Kong studios ignited the galaxy, featuring icons like Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan. Yet, their focus on Chinese culture, often disconnected from mainland China, inadvertently left Chinese representation dimmer than expected.

 3. **Studio Ghibli’s Success (1981–1995)**
Ghibli’s enchanted worlds soared beyond live action, painting the cinematic skies with animated wonders. This era widened Japan’s influence, adding new spectrums of representation to the East Asian cinematic cosmos.

4. **Korean Wave (1996–2012)**
Korea burst onto the interstellar stage, propelled by creations like Oldboy and The Host. Government backing and the magnetic allure of Hallyu forged a luminous era, shaping perception and representation far beyond Earth’s horizons.

**Chinese Cinema:** A giant slumbering star, its light often obscured by historical and political nebulae.

**Japanese & Korean Cinema:** Celestial innovators, radiating new energies across global screens. Japan’s timeless masters and Ghibli’s poetic visions, Korea’s blazing comet of global appeal—together they weave a vibrant cosmic tapestry in East Asian cinema’s evolving universe.

# **Age Analysis of the East Asian Movie Industry**

## **Introduction**

From the cosmic vantage point, we now turn our telescopes towards the dimension of age. 

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/20797056"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script><noscript><img src="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/20797056/thumbnail" width="100%" alt="chart visualization" /></noscript></div>

## **Dominance of Youth Representation:**

Across all plots, youth seizes center stage, with actor ages tightly clustered in the 20–40 range. Meanwhile, real-world populations sing a more harmonious tune—age flows seamlessly from energetic youth through to wise elders. Yet cinema bends toward younger faces, perhaps reflecting the industry’s vision of what audiences crave: an evergreen horizon of vigor and possibility.

## **Gender-Based Differences:**

*Females:*
A strong peak emerges in the 20–30 age group, tapering sharply beyond 40. This whispers of bias in Earth’s casting rituals, favoring youthful allure while sidelining older women, their stories drifting into the unseen depths of the cinematic cosmos.

*Males:*
Males ascend to their prime slightly later, peaking in the 30–40 year band. Unlike their female counterparts, men remain in the spotlight a bit longer, stretching their on-screen journeys into more mature chapters.

Let’s delve deeper into these patterns with violin plots that reveal the subtle frequencies of this age-distribution symphony.



To anchor our insights, we navigated human knowledge archives. The book Women in *East Asian Cinema: Gender Representations, Creative Labour and Global Histories* illuminates how cultural norms and industry habits push older women into cinematic shadows, consistently favoring younger female actors.

## **Gender Proportion Analysis**

<!-- this part is where we have the visualisation for east asia of the common plot of gender -->

<div style="display: flex; align-items: up; justify-content: space-between;">
  
  <!-- Text Container -->
  <div style="width: 40%; padding: 8px;">
    <p>

- **Male Dominance Across Genres:**

In all observed Earthly time streams, the energy signatures of male entities surpass those of females, particularly in the high-thrill zones of Action/Adventure and Science Fiction.
*1996–2012:* During this planetary phase, male entities dominated most genres, with their highest peak proportions of 71.0% in Action/Adventure and 67.2% in Thriller/Suspense.

- **Genre-Specific Representation:**

In some territories like **Drama**, there is a slow yet steady rise in female energy waves over time.
Meanwhile, the cosmic zones of **Romance** and **Horror** glow brighter with higher female presence.

- **Real-World Comparison:**

In the vast expanse of Earth's real-world population, the gender split leans approximately 55% female and 45% male—a balance most logical and natural.

Let us now dive deeper into the cosmic currents of gender representation by looking into the **Chi-Square Test:**

*Hypotheses*
1. **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**:  
   The gender proportions in East Asian cinema match the real-world population proportions (no significant difference).

2. **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**:  
   The gender proportions in East Asian cinema differ significantly from real-world population proportions.

  <!-- Text Container -->
  <div style="flex: 1; padding: 10px;">
    <p>

 *Interpretation*
1. **Chi-Square Statistic (14.77)**:  
   This measures the discrepancy between observed (cinema proportions) and expected (real-world proportions) values. It indicates a greater deviation from the expected proportions.

2. **P-Value (0.00012)**:  
   The p-value is much smaller than the standard significance threshold (e.g., 0.05). This means the result is statistically significant.

   |----------------------------|--------------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Observed vs. Expected (All)| ~14.77              | ~0.00012        | Reject H₀, significant difference between observed and expected |

*Conclusion:*

**Reject the Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: The gender proportions in East Asian cinema are significantly different from real-world gender proportions.
Though beings classified as *Females* constitute 55% of Earth’s population, their luminous presence is dimmed and shadowed in the cinematic landscape.

This imbalance we observe aligns with knowledge inscribed by Earth’s thinkers.
The book *Women in East Asian Cinema: Gender Representations, Creative Labour and Global Histories* explores how the contributions of women have been historically diminished and overlooked in these cinematic domains.
