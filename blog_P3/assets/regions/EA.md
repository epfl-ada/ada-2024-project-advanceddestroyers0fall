# **East Asian Cluster**

From my cosmic vantage point, East Asia shimmers as a constellation of ancient civilizations and vibrant cultures. Yet as I peer closer, its cinematic landscapes seem to bend and refract, revealing patterns both illuminated and obscured. Let’s drift inward and discover what the data unveils about this region.

# **Ethnicity Comparative Analysis of the East Asian Movie Industry**

## **Introduction**

My aim here is to decode how East Asia’s vibrant cinematic mosaic reflects the region's intricate ethnic tapestry. From my cosmic perch, I chart these distributions to determine whether these patterns are mere cosmic dust or reveal deeper, gravitational biases molding the images on screen.

## **Preliminary Visualizations of Ethnic Representation Over Time**

Gazing through these earthly lenses, I find that **Chinese populations**, despite forming the largest demographic, remain curiously overshadowed in certain cinematic genres and eras. It’s as if their stellar mass fails to bend the narrative light, leaving them dimmer than one might expect.

In contrast, **Korean** and **Japanese** ethnicities shine brighter, overrepresented in genres like Drama and Science Fiction. Earth’s storytellers here seem drawn to specific cultural identities, allowing these groups to bask in the cinematic glow, while others recede into the cosmic background.

To see this phenomenon more vividly, let’s inspect the pie chart comparing real-world demographics to East Asia’s on-screen universe from 1996 to 2012.

## **Introduction**

From the cosmic vantage point, we now turn our telescopes towards the dimension of age. 

## **Preliminary Plots: Actor vs. Real-World Age Distributions**


## **Dominance of Youth Representation:**

Across all plots, youth seizes center stage, with actor ages tightly clustered in the 20–40 range. Meanwhile, real-world populations sing a more harmonious tune—age flows seamlessly from energetic youth through to wise elders. Yet cinema bends toward younger faces, perhaps reflecting the industry’s vision of what audiences crave: an evergreen horizon of vigor and possibility.

## **Gender-Based Differences:**

*Females:*
A strong peak emerges in the 20–30 age group, tapering sharply beyond 40. This whispers of bias in Earth’s casting rituals, favoring youthful allure while sidelining older women, their stories drifting into the unseen depths of the cinematic cosmos.

*Males:*
Males ascend to their prime slightly later, peaking in the 30–40 year band. Unlike their female counterparts, men remain in the spotlight a bit longer, stretching their on-screen journeys into more mature chapters.

Let’s delve deeper into these patterns with violin plots that reveal the subtle frequencies of this age-distribution symphony.



To anchor our insights, we navigated human knowledge archives. The book Women in *East Asian Cinema: Gender Representations, Creative Labour and Global Histories* illuminates how cultural norms and industry habits push older women into cinematic shadows, consistently favoring younger female actors.

- **Real-World Comparison:**

In the vast expanse of Earth's real-world population, the gender split leans approximately 55% female and 45% male—a balance most logical and natural.

Let us now dive deeper into the cosmic currents of gender representation by looking into the **Chi-Square Test:**

*Hypotheses*
1. **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**:  
   The gender proportions in East Asian cinema match the real-world population proportions (no significant difference).

2. **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**:  
   The gender proportions in East Asian cinema differ significantly from real-world population proportions.

  <!-- Text Container -->
  <div style="flex: 1; padding: 10px;">
    <p>

 *Interpretation*
1. **Chi-Square Statistic (14.77)**:  
   This measures the discrepancy between observed (cinema proportions) and expected (real-world proportions) values. It indicates a greater deviation from the expected proportions.

2. **P-Value (0.00012)**:  
   The p-value is much smaller than the standard significance threshold (e.g., 0.05). This means the result is statistically significant.

   | Observed vs. Expected (All)| ~14.77              | ~0.00012        | Reject H₀, significant difference between observed and expected |

   

  </p>
  </div>

  </div>


*Conclusion:*

**Reject the Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: The gender proportions in East Asian cinema are significantly different from real-world gender proportions.
Though beings classified as *Females* constitute 55% of Earth’s population, their luminous presence is dimmed and shadowed in the cinematic landscape.

This imbalance we observe aligns with knowledge inscribed by Earth’s thinkers.
The book *Women in East Asian Cinema: Gender Representations, Creative Labour and Global Histories* explores how the contributions of women have been historically diminished and overlooked in these cinematic domains.

# Integrated Analysis of Cinematic Representation Gaps and Box Office Revenue

---

# Introduction

As I drifted among Earth’s cultural constellations, I ventured into a grand endeavor: to understand how the movies Earthlings cherish align—or misalign—with the demographic patterns of your own reality. Anchored in three key metrics—**Ethnicity**, **Age**, and **Gender**—I sought to quantify representation gaps between real-world populations and the actors who grace Earthlings' screens. By examining how these discrepancies evolved through time and across regions, and by linking them to the gravitational pull of box office revenue, I hoped to uncover whether economic currents encourage such imbalances.

To explore this cinematic cosmos, I employed multiple observational instruments and analytical methods:

1. **Radial Tree Plot**: A visual galaxy mapping how movie success categories (Highly Successful, Successful, Normal) link to various genres and regions.  
2. **Combination Dual-Axis Charts**: Temporal journeys tracking representation gaps and box office revenue across decades, regions, and metrics. These help us see if changes in gaps mirror changes in revenue.  
3. **Sankey Plots**: Flows of movies from representation gap intervals to genres and ultimately to success categories, aggregated over the entire 1950–2012 period. These highlight structural associations between gap magnitude, genre choice, and final revenue outcomes.  
4. **Linear Regression Analyses**: Statistical attempts to measure a direct relationship between representation gaps and box office performance, both in simple forms (just gap vs. revenue) and more complex forms (controlling for metric type and temporal batches).

Armed with these tools, I can piece together a narrative: Does the industry’s portrayal of different ethnicities, genders, and ages shape—or is shaped by—its economic incentives?

---

# Methodology Adopted

**Representation Gaps**:  
For each metric (Ethnicity, Age, Gender), I computed representation gaps as absolute percentage differences between the movie populations and the corresponding real-world demographic proportions. The larger the gap, the further the industry strayed from mirroring Earth’s demographic reality. These gaps were calculated for each region (Hollywood, Bollywood, East Asia, Europe), across multiple 10-year time batches (1950–1959, 1960–1969, …, 2010–2012).

**Box Office Revenue**:  
To assess economic outcomes, I examined aggregated box office revenues (mean per batch or overall distributions) and categorized movies into percentile-based success categories:  
- **Highly Successful**: Top 10% by revenue  
- **Successful**: 40th to 90th percentile  
- **Normal**: Below the 40th percentile

By pairing these success categories with representation gaps, I hoped to see if achieving higher revenues demanded certain demographic imbalances.

**Same Metrics as Before**:  
I consistently used the same age, gender, and ethnicity data, ensuring coherence with previous analyses. Through all these steps—radial plots, line/area charts, Sankey diagrams, and regressions—the fundamental metrics and methods remained stable, allowing a comprehensive cross-check.

---

# The Four Analytical Works

## 1. Radial Tree Plot

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-hierarchy" data-src="visualisation/20820914"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script><noscript><img src="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/20820914/thumbnail" width="100%" alt="hierarchy visualization" /></noscript></div>

This plot arranges genres around a circular axis, with success categories branching outward. Across all regions or within each one, we see how different genres populate these success tiers.

**Key Insights**:  
- **Global Patterns**: Action/Adventure and mass-appeal genres often cluster in Highly Successful tiers, indicating that big-budget spectacle transcends cultural borders. Documentaries and more niche genres hover in the Successful or Normal zones, mirroring their limited commercial appeal.  
- **Regional Nuances**: Hollywood’s penchant for Action/Adventure and Sci-Fi dominates the top revenue stratum, Bollywood’s Romance/Drama tradition finds consistent but not always top-tier success, East Asia’s Thriller/Suspense or locally favored genres anchor their success tiers, and Europe’s arthouse tilt shows fewer blockbuster hits.  
- **Link to Representation Gaps**: Although the radial tree plot does not directly show demographic gaps, it complements previous findings. Genres historically associated with skewed demographics still rank highly, suggesting that economic success often aligns with entrenched formulas, regardless of representational parity.

By showing the final distribution of genres into success categories, the radial chart reveals that commercial viability is often genre-driven and shaped by longstanding cultural and industrial norms—not necessarily by aligning closely with real-world demographics.

## 2. Combination Dual-Axis Charts

  </div>

</div>



These charts overlay representation gaps and box office revenue over the decades, providing a temporal lens. For each region and metric, we see how gaps and revenue evolve together or diverge.

**Key Insights**:  
- **No Universal Trend**: Some periods show growing representation gaps alongside rising box office, others show shrinking gaps paired with stable revenue. This variation undermines any simple causal narrative.  
- **Cultural and Historical Context**: Hollywood’s shifts might reflect the blockbuster era, the influence of social movements, or global expansion. Bollywood’s stable star system could make representation gaps economically irrelevant. East Asia’s homogeneity might keep high gaps stable without penalty. Europe’s arthouse markets don’t necessarily reward more balanced demographics with big commercial wins.  
- **Societal Phenomena**: Periods of civil rights activism or global cultural exchange might nudge representation toward slightly narrower gaps without harming box office returns. Nonetheless, the data shows no strong pattern of “more representative = more revenue” or “less representative = more revenue.” Instead, genre cycles, star vehicles, and distribution networks overshadow demographic fine-tuning.

By capturing changes over decades, these combination dual-axis charts illustrate that economic success is molded by historical forces and market evolutions rather than a direct or stable representation-gap-to-revenue pipeline.

## 3. Representation Gaps and Box Office Revenue Impact

  </div>


</div>




The Sankey diagrams show the different flows of movies from representation gap intervals to genres and then to success categories. This tri-level mapping helps identify structural patterns.

**Key Insights**:  
- **Large Gap Intervals Still Yield Success**: If flows from high-gap categories ([50,75] or even [75,100]) lead into popular genres and ultimately into Highly Successful categories, it implies that entrenched demographic imbalances did not prevent lucrative outcomes.  
- **Genre as an Economic Mediator**: Some genres consistently channel movies into Successful or even Highly Successful tiers, regardless of gap size. This supports the idea that genre preferences and star power might be more influential than demographic realism.  
- **Comparing Metrics and Regions**: In Hollywood, large-gap intervals feeding into Action/Adventure and then into Highly Successful categories confirm that commercial formulas, not representational accuracy, often drive profit. Bollywood’s stable success of Romance/Drama under large gaps indicates similarly entrenched formulas. East Asia and Europe show analogous patterns, each with their local twists.

The Sankey plots, by exposing stable “flows” from gap categories to success categories, reinforce the notion that representation gap levels are not strong determinants of economic fate. Instead, the industry’s gravitational fields—rooted in genre traditions and audience tastes—predominantly shape financial success.

---

## 4. Linear Regression Analyses



After visually exploring patterns, I turned to linear and multiple regressions to seek a statistical relationship between representation gap and box office.

<!-- Dropdown pour chaque région ici-->

<iframe src="/assets/plots/box-office/regression_plot_Hollywood.html" width="100%" height="400px" style="border:none;"></iframe>

**Key Insights**:  
- **Simple Regression Weakness**: Only Hollywood’s simple regression suggested a modest negative relationship (higher gap = slightly lower revenue), but even that was weak.  
- **Multiple Regression Overfitting**: Controlling for Metric and 10-year Batch labels explained all variation, leaving Representation Gap insignificant. This implies time and categorical differences, not demographic alignment, dominate the statistical landscape.  
- **Across Regions**: Bollywood, East Asia, and Europe showed no meaningful linear association between gap and revenue. The complex interplay of cultural history, market size, and genre preference overwhelms any direct linear effect of representation gaps.

These regressions confirm that once we factor in historical context (time periods) and differing metrics (ethnicity, age, gender), representation gap ceases to matter statistically. This supports the broader narrative: no simple numeric gap measure can predict box office returns reliably.

# Bringing It All Together

Across four distinct works, one message emerges: **economic success in cinema does not strongly hinge on how closely movie demographics match real-world populations.**

- **Radial Tree Plot**: Shows that globally favored genres secure top-tier revenue regardless of representational fidelity, hinting that economic incentives didn’t enforce representational balance.  
- **Combination Dual-Axis Charts**: Demonstrate that representation gaps fluctuate with historical forces, yet these fluctuations do not consistently correlate with higher or lower box office revenues. The industry’s formulas and cultural shifts matter more.  
- **Sankey Plots**: Aggregated flows reveal that even large demographic imbalances often feed into highly successful tiers via certain lucrative genres, reinforcing the idea that entrenched production norms hold sway over economic outcomes.  
- **Linear Regression Analysis**: Statistically confirms that once historical eras and metric categories are considered, representation gap loses explanatory power. No straightforward causal or linear link emerges between gap and revenue.

**Contextualizing with Societal and Historical Research**:  
Earth's real-world scholarship, from the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative’s studies on representation to historical accounts of Hollywood’s studio system, corroborate these patterns. Social movements for diversity have nudged changes, but the box office bottom line seems driven more by star systems, blockbuster formulas, and marketing prowess than by demographic accuracy. Bollywood’s reliance on established stars and romance genres, East Asia’s local genre preferences, and Europe’s arthouse identity all reflect entrenched market conditions rather than demographic rectifications.

**Conclusion**:  
My cosmic exploration suggests that, while moral and cultural arguments for better representation are robust and well-documented, purely economic motives don’t straightforwardly reward or punish representational fidelity. Cinematic ecosystems seem able to thrive financially under various demographic distributions, relying instead on traditional genres, star legacies, and shifting audience tastes. To alter these constellations of representation, external sociopolitical forces, audience advocacy, and institutional reforms may be required—beyond the gravitational pull of the box office itself.

In sum, the works we assembled act like telescopes and spectrometers. They reveal a complex cinematic universe where demographic reality often bends under the weight of tradition, cultural myths, and economic expediency. True demographic alignment might not guarantee a bigger cosmic payoff, but the pursuit of a cinema that mirrors its audience’s diversity might still resonate with Earth’s evolving sense of justice and authenticity.
