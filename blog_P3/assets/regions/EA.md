# **Ethnicity Comparative Analysis of the East Asian Movie Industry**

## **Introduction**

My aim here is to decode how East Asia’s vibrant cinematic mosaic reflects the region's intricate ethnic tapestry. I analyze these distributions to determine whether the patterns are random occurrences or reflect deeper biases shaping what appears on screen.

## **Preliminary Visualizations of Ethnic Representation Over Time**

Gazing through these earthly lenses, I find that **Chinese populations**, despite forming the largest demographic, remain curiously overshadowed in certain cinematic genres and eras. It’s as if their stellar mass fails to bend the narrative light, leaving them dimmer than one might expect.

In contrast, **Korean** and **Japanese** ethnicities shine brighter, overrepresented in genres like Drama and Science Fiction. Earth’s storytellers here seem drawn to specific cultural identities, allowing these groups to bask in the cinematic glow, while others recede into the cosmic background.

To see this phenomenon more vividly, let’s inspect the pie chart comparing real-world demographics to East Asia’s on-screen universe from 1996 to 2012.

1. **Golden Age of Japanese Cinema (1950–1965)**
Japan’s cinematic brilliance shone like a supernova—Kurosawa, Ozu, Mizoguchi—names that anchored the industry’s celestial map. Post-war resilience and profound storytelling gave rise to a strong ethnic presence. [1]

2. **Rise of Martial Arts Films (1966–1980)**
Martial arts films from Hong Kong studios ignited the galaxy, featuring icons like Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan. Yet, their focus on Chinese culture, often disconnected from mainland China, inadvertently left Chinese representation dimmer than expected. [2]

 <!-- Plot Container -->
  <div style="flex: 1; padding: 10px;">

 3. **Studio Ghibli’s Success (1981–1995)**
Ghibli’s enchanted worlds soared beyond live action, painting the cinematic skies with animated wonders. This era widened Japan’s influence, adding new spectrums of representation to the East Asian cinematic cosmos. [3]


4. **Korean Wave (1996–2012)**
Korea burst onto the interstellar stage, propelled by creations like Oldboy and The Host. Government backing and the magnetic allure of Hallyu forged a luminous era, shaping perception and representation far beyond Earth’s horizons. [4]

# **Age Analysis of the East Asian Movie Industry**


## **Preliminary Plots: Actor vs. Real-World Age Distributions**

<!-- Dropdown ici -->



---

## **Dominance of Youth Representation:**

Across all plots, youth seizes center stage, with actor ages tightly clustered in the 20–40 range. Meanwhile, real-world populations sing a more harmonious tune—age flows seamlessly from energetic youth through to wise elders. Yet cinema bends toward younger faces, perhaps reflecting the industry’s vision of what audiences crave: an evergreen horizon of vigor and possibility.

## **Gender-Based Differences:**

*Females:*
A strong peak emerges in the 20–30 age group, tapering sharply beyond 40. This whispers of bias in Earth’s casting rituals, favoring youthful allure while sidelining older women, their stories drifting into the unseen depths of the cinematic cosmos.

*Males:*
Males ascend to their prime slightly later, peaking in the 30–40 year band. Unlike their female counterparts, men remain in the spotlight a bit longer, stretching their on-screen journeys into more mature chapters.

Let’s delve deeper into these patterns with violin plots that reveal the subtle frequencies of this age-distribution symphony.



To anchor our insights, we navigated human knowledge archives. The book Women in *East Asian Cinema: Gender Representations, Creative Labour and Global Histories* illuminates how cultural norms and industry habits push older women into cinematic shadows, consistently favoring younger female actors.

- **Real-World Comparison:**

In the vast expanse of Earth's real-world population, the gender split leans approximately 55% female and 45% male—a balance most logical and natural.

Let us now dive deeper into the cosmic currents of gender representation by looking into the **Chi-Square Test:**

*Hypotheses*
1. **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**:  
   The gender proportions in East Asian cinema match the real-world population proportions (no significant difference).

2. **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**:  
   The gender proportions in East Asian cinema differ significantly from real-world population proportions.

  <div style="flex: 1; padding: 10px;">
    <p>

 *Interpretation*
1. **Chi-Square Statistic (14.77)**:  
   This measures the discrepancy between observed (cinema proportions) and expected (real-world proportions) values. It indicates a greater deviation from the expected proportions.

  <!-- Plot Container -->
  <div style="flex: 1; padding: 10px;">
      <p>

2. **P-Value (0.00012)**:  
   The p-value is much smaller than the standard significance threshold (e.g., 0.05). This means the result is statistically significant.
   

  </p>
  </div>

  </div>


*Conclusion:*

**Reject the Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: The gender proportions in East Asian cinema are significantly different from real-world gender proportions.
Though beings classified as *Females* constitute 55% of Earth’s population, their luminous presence is dimmed and shadowed in the cinematic landscape.

This imbalance we observe aligns with knowledge inscribed by Earth’s thinkers.
The book *Women in East Asian Cinema: Gender Representations, Creative Labour and Global Histories* explores how the contributions of women have been historically diminished and overlooked in these cinematic domains.[[5]]

# **Overwork Culture Analysis in East Asia**

The overwork culture in East Asia—referred to as **"karoshi"** in Japan, **"gwarosa"** in Korea, and **"996"** in China—has become a significant societal issue, often linked to mental health challenges, family breakdowns, and even crime. As I analyzed the data, I couldn’t help but notice how this culture of excessive work hours is reflected (or overlooked) in cinema.



<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; align-items: flex-start;">
  <!-- Text Content -->
  <div style="flex: 1; padding: 10px;">

**Real-Life Statistics on Overwork:** [6], [7]
- **Japan:** In 2022, 10.1% of men and 4.2% of women worked over 60 hours a week.  
- **South Korea:** The government recently reduced the maximum workweek from 68 to 52 hours to combat long-standing overwork issues.  
- **China:** The “996” culture, working 9 am to 9 pm six days a week, equates to a grueling 72-hour workweek.

**Work Hours vs. Movie Representation:**
- **Japan:** Despite having the lowest normalized work hours (\~77%), Japanese movies address overwork themes most frequently (\~50%).  
- **South Korea:** With moderate work hours (~90%), overwork appears in only ~12% of movies.  
- **China:** Though work hours are the highest (~100%), overwork themes surface in just ~18% of Chinese cinema.

  </div>

  <!-- Plot Content -->
  <div style="flex: 1; padding: 10px; display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">

<iframe src="/assets/plots/EA/eastasian_theme_analysis_themes_over_time.html" width="100%" height="400px" style="border:none;"></iframe>

**Cultural Implications:**  
Japanese cinema appears to be a critical mirror, shedding light on workplace issues and sparking societal awareness. By contrast, China’s lower cinematic focus on overwork might reflect cultural hesitations or differing priorities when addressing workplace struggles on screen. South Korea falls somewhere in between, with workplace issues receiving limited attention in its films.


These patterns left me pondering: do these representations, or lack thereof, serve as subtle critiques of their respective societies, or do they simply mirror cultural norms and expectations surrounding work?

# Integrated Analysis of Cinematic Representation Gaps and Box Office Revenue

---

# Introduction

As I explored Earth's diverse cultures, I took on a mission to understand how movies reflect—or differ from—real-world demographics. Focusing on three key factors—**Ethnicity**, **Age**, and **Gender**—I analyzed gaps between the real-world population and the actors on screen. By studying how these differences changed over time and across regions, and by examining their connection to box office earnings, I aimed to uncover whether economic factors drive these imbalances.

To explore this cinematic landscape, I used several tools and methods:

1. **Radial Tree Plot**: A visual map showing how movie success levels (Highly Successful, Successful, Normal) connect to different genres and regions.  
2. **Combination Dual-Axis Charts**: Tracking representation gaps and box office revenue over time, across decades, regions, and metrics, to see if changes in representation align with changes in revenue.  
3. **Sankey Plots**: Visualizing the flow of movies from representation gap levels to genres and then to success categories, covering the entire 1950–2012 period, to uncover patterns between gap size, genre, and revenue.  
4. **Linear Regression Analyses**: Statistical models to explore whether representation gaps directly impact box office performance, both simply (gap vs. revenue) and with additional factors like metric type and time periods.

With these tools, I aim to answer: Does how the industry represents ethnicity, gender, and age influence—or get influenced by—its financial goals?

---

# Methodology Adopted

**Representation Gaps**:  
For each metric—**Ethnicity**, **Age**, and **Gender**—I calculated representation gaps as the absolute percentage difference between movie demographics and real-world proportions. Larger gaps indicate a greater deviation from Earth’s demographic reality. These gaps were measured for each region (Hollywood, Bollywood, East Asia, Europe) across 10-year periods (1950–1959, 1960–1969, …, 2010–2012).

**Box Office Revenue**:  
To evaluate economic outcomes, I analyzed box office revenues (average per decade or overall distributions) and grouped movies into success categories based on percentiles:  
- **Highly Successful**: Top 10% of revenue  
- **Successful**: 40th to 90th percentile  
- **Normal**: Below the 40th percentile  

By linking these success categories to representation gaps, I aimed to see if certain demographic imbalances were associated with higher revenues.

**Same Metrics as Before**:  
I consistently used the same age, gender, and ethnicity data throughout the analysis. Whether using radial plots, line/area charts, Sankey diagrams, or regression models, the metrics and methods remained stable, to ensure a reliable cross-check.

---

# The Four Analytical Works

## 1. Radial Tree Plot

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-hierarchy" data-src="visualisation/20820914"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script><noscript><img src="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/20820914/thumbnail" width="100%" alt="hierarchy visualization" /></noscript></div>

This plot arranges genres around a circular axis, with success categories branching outward. It shows how different genres fall into these success tiers, either globally or within specific regions.

**Key Insights**:  
- **Global Patterns**: Action/Adventure and other mass-appeal genres often dominate the Highly Successful tier, highlighting their universal appeal. In contrast, documentaries and niche genres tend to cluster in the Successful or Normal zones, reflecting their limited commercial draw.  
- **Regional Nuances**: Hollywood excels in Action/Adventure and Sci-Fi at the top revenue levels, while Bollywood’s Romance/Drama is consistently successful but not always a blockbuster. East Asia finds success with Thriller/Suspense and locally popular genres, while Europe’s focus on arthouse films results in fewer major hits.  
- **Link to Representation Gaps**: While the radial tree plot doesn’t directly show demographic gaps, it complements earlier findings. Genres often tied to skewed demographics still perform well, suggesting economic success frequently relies on established industry formulas rather than demographic representation.

By mapping the distribution of genres into success categories, the chart highlights how commercial success is heavily influenced by genre preferences shaped by cultural and industry norms, rather than strict alignment with real-world demographics.

*For the Combination Dual-Axis Charts and Sankey diagrams, while results from other regions were analyzed as part of our cosmic experiment, only Hollywood's results are displayed to prioritize rendering efficiency, given its status as Earth's cinematic powerhouse.*

## 2. Combination Dual-Axis Charts: Hollywood

<!-- Dropdown pour chaque région ici-->

These charts overlay representation gaps and box office revenue over the decades, providing a temporal lens. For each region and metric, we see how gaps and revenue evolve together or diverge.

**Key Insights**:  
- **No Universal Trend**: Some periods show larger representation gaps with rising box office revenues, while others show smaller gaps with steady earnings. This inconsistency challenges any straightforward cause-and-effect narrative.  
- **Cultural and Historical Context**: Hollywood’s shifts may reflect the blockbuster era, social movements, or global market influence. Bollywood’s stable star system might make representation gaps less relevant to revenue. East Asia’s homogeneity may sustain large gaps without economic impact, while Europe’s arthouse focus doesn’t necessarily reward balanced representation with high earnings.  
- **Societal Phenomena**: Civil rights movements or global cultural exchanges may have slightly narrowed gaps without reducing box office returns. However, the data doesn’t support a clear link between “better representation = more revenue” or “worse representation = more revenue.” Instead, factors like genre trends, star power, and distribution strategies play a larger role.

By capturing changes over decades, these combination dual-axis charts illustrate that economic success is molded by historical forces and market evolutions rather than a direct or stable representation-gap-to-revenue pipeline.

---

## 3. Representation Gaps and Box Office Revenue Impact: Hollywood

<!-- Dropdown pour chaque région ici-->


The Sankey diagrams show the different flows of movies from representation gap intervals to genres and then to success categories. This tri-level mapping helps identify structural patterns.

**Key Insights**:  
- **Large Gap Intervals Still Yield Success**: Movies from large-gap categories (e.g., [50–75] or even [75–100]) often flow into popular genres and end up in Highly Successful tiers, showing that significant demographic imbalances don’t necessarily hinder profitability.  
- **Genre as an Economic Mediator**: Certain genres consistently push movies into Successful or Highly Successful tiers, regardless of demographic gaps. This suggests that genre preferences and star appeal often outweigh the importance of demographic representation.  
- **Comparing Metrics and Regions**: In Hollywood, large-gap movies often succeed in Action/Adventure genres, emphasizing that commercial success relies on tried-and-true formulas rather than representational accuracy. Bollywood’s steady success with Romance/Drama under high gaps reflects similar patterns. East Asia and Europe also exhibit these trends, with regional variations.

The Sankey plots, by exposing stable “flows” from gap categories to success categories, reinforce the notion that representation gap levels are not strong determinants of economic fate. Instead, the industry’s gravitational fields—rooted in genre traditions and audience tastes—predominantly shape financial success.

---

## 4. Linear Regression Analyses



After visually exploring patterns, I turned to linear and multiple regressions to seek a statistical relationship between representation gap and box office.

<!-- Dropdown pour chaque région ici-->


**Key Insights**:  
- **Limitations of Simple Regression**: Only Hollywood showed a slight negative relationship (higher gap = slightly lower revenue), but even this connection was weak.  
- **Overfitting in Multiple Regression**: When accounting for Metric and 10-year Batch labels, Representation Gap became statistically insignificant. This indicates that time periods and categorical differences, not demographic alignment, primarily explain the variation.  
- **Regional Analysis**: In Bollywood, East Asia, and Europe, no clear linear relationship between gaps and revenue was found. The complex mix of cultural history, market size, and genre preferences overshadows any straightforward effect of representation gaps.

These regressions confirm that, after accounting for historical context and metric differences, representation gaps have no significant statistical impact. This reinforces the idea that no simple gap measure can reliably predict box office success.



---

# Bringing It All Together

Across four distinct works, one message emerges: **economic success in cinema does not strongly hinge on how closely movie demographics match real-world populations.**

- **Radial Tree Plot**: Highlights that globally popular genres consistently achieve top-tier revenue, regardless of representational accuracy, suggesting that economic incentives don’t drive balanced representation.  
- **Combination Dual-Axis Charts**: Show that representation gaps change with historical trends, but these shifts don’t reliably link to higher or lower box office revenues. Industry formulas and cultural movements play a bigger role.  
- **Sankey Plots**: Reveal that even movies with significant demographic imbalances often succeed in top revenue tiers through profitable genres, emphasizing the dominance of established production norms over representation concerns.  
- **Linear Regression Analysis**: Confirms that when historical periods and metric types are accounted for, representation gaps have little impact. There’s no clear linear or causal relationship between gaps and revenue.

**Contextualizing with Societal and Historical Research**:  
Studies like those from the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative and historical analyses of Hollywood’s studio system confirm these trends. While social movements for diversity have influenced change, box office success still relies more on star power, blockbuster formulas, and marketing strategies than on accurate demographic representation. Bollywood primarily centers on big-name stars and romance genres as its key to success. East Asia tends to favor genres that appeal to local audiences, while Europe leans heavily toward arthouse films. These trends highlight how each region’s movie industry is shaped by long-standing market preferences and economic strategies, rather than by actively trying to improve demographic representation.


**Conclusion**:  
My cosmic exploration suggests that, while moral and cultural arguments for better representation are robust and well-documented, purely economic motives don’t straightforwardly reward or punish representational fidelity. Cinematic ecosystems seem able to thrive financially under various demographic distributions, relying instead on traditional genres, star legacies, and shifting audience tastes. To alter these constellations of representation, external sociopolitical forces, audience advocacy, and institutional reforms may be required—beyond the gravitational pull of the box office itself.

In sum, the works we assembled act like telescopes and spectrometers. They reveal a complex cinematic universe where demographic reality often bends under the weight of tradition, cultural myths, and economic expediency. True demographic alignment might not guarantee a bigger cosmic payoff, but the pursuit of a cinema that mirrors its audience’s diversity might still resonate with Earth’s evolving sense of justice and authenticity.
