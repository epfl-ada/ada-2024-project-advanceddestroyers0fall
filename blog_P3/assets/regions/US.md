    <p>
      Hollywood, as Earth’s most influential cinematic powerhouse, seems to wield gravity akin to a small star: it dictates how stories are told, who gets to tell them, and how populations perceive themselves and others. Through its films, it claims to mirror the social, cultural, and demographic realities of your planet. Yet, from my vantage point drifting among the cosmic currents, it appears more like a funhouse mirror, distorting these earthly realities. As I navigated Earth’s cultural landscapes, I detected recurring patterns in these moving images: certain groups elevated while others fade into the cosmic background, certain ages exalted while others ignored, and gender dynamics frequently falling short of what humans might call “balance.”

# **Ethnicity Comparative Analysis of the Hollywood Movie Industry**

## **Introduction**

My first goal on this planet is to focus on ethnicity within Hollywood’s actor population, to see if what appears on screen reflects the complex ethnic tapestry of this region. From my starship, I first project these distributions onto my observation deck, then apply Earthly statistical tests—like chi-square tests—to determine whether these patterns arise from random chance or a more deliberate pattern.

---

## **Preliminary Visualizations of Ethnic Representation Over Time**

<!--Dropdown ici -->


<!-- All Periods -->

These plots reveal how each ethnic group’s representation ratio (film presence vs. Earthly presence) shifted from 1950 to 2012, across various cinematic genres. Positive values indicate overrepresentation, negative values indicate underrepresentation. As I traced these earthly time lines, I observed fluctuations influenced by historical events, societal changes, and Hollywood’s ever-shifting cinematic constellations.

---
## **Statistical Validation: Chi-Square Tests**

To move beyond my mere cosmic impressions, I employed the chi-square test, a human statistical tool that measures whether observed frequencies differ from expected ones. If this difference is too large to be cosmic coincidence, we can infer a true systematic deviation in Hollywood’s stellar casting patterns.

<div style="display: flex; align-items: up; justify-content: space-between;">
  <!-- Text Container -->
  <div style="flex: 1; padding: 10px;">
    <p>

1. **Chi-Square Test for Observed vs. Expected Frequencies (All genres combined):**  
   After aggregating data from all the Earthly periods, I compared observed ethnic frequencies among Hollywood actors to those expected, if real-world proportions were accurately mirrored. The chi-square statistic (~36878.69, p-value ~0.0) suggests we can safely reject the null hypothesis that Hollywood’s distribution is in sync with reality.


    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- Plot Container -->
  <div style="flex: 1; padding: 10px;">
      <p>

2. **Chi-Square Test for Genre-Dependence:**  
   Another test examined if these ethnic distributions depend on genre. With a chi-square statistic of about 881.15 and a p-value near 6.7e-150, it’s undeniable: different genres pull different ethnic groups into their gravitational orbits. Documentaries, for example, might spotlight marginalized communities more than, say, an action blockbuster would.

    </p>
  </div>

  
  </div>


Clearly, Hollywood’s ethnic actor distribution is skewed, not a neat cosmic alignment.

---

## **Interpretation of Ethnicity Trends**

Armed with these statistical findings, I examined historical context and Earthly narratives to understand the patterns:

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: space-between;">
  
  <!-- Text Container -->
  <div style="flex : 1; padding: 10px;">
    <p>


- **Jewish Populations:**  
  Overrepresented in early decades, mirroring the historical influence of Jewish entrepreneurs who helped shape Hollywood’s initial star cluster. Over time, while still significant, this dominance receded as the industry’s nebula grew more diverse.

- **American Indians:**  
  Initially underrepresented, they became more visible in certain genres, like Documentaries, post-1960. Perhaps a reflection of growing Earthly interest in acknowledging indigenous histories.


    </p>

</div>
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: space-between;">
  
  <!-- Text Container -->
  <div style="flex: 1; padding: 10px;">
    <p>

- **African Americans:**  
  Once marginalized, their representation improved after the 1960s. Civil rights movements and influential African American directors served as new stars, lighting the cinematic sky with more inclusive brilliance.

- **Asian Americans:**  
  Their representation remained low but featured occasional spikes, often tied to sudden trends (martial arts, for example) rather than steady growth. It’s a pattern of intermittent flares rather than a stable constellation.

    </p>
  </div>
  
  <!-- Plot Container -->
  <div style="flex: 1; padding: 10px;">
      <p>

- **Arab and Latino Americans:**  
  Persistently underrepresented, these groups struggle against entrenched biases and stereotypes. Despite minor improvements, the gravitational pull of old assumptions seems hard to escape.

- **Caucasians:**  
  Historically dominant, their relative share diminishes only as others brighten. Even this “reduction” is more about rebalancing the cosmic stage than any actual decline to minority status.

  </p>
  </div>
</div>



In essence, these ethnicity patterns reflect Earth’s layered histories, sociopolitical shifts, and the market forces that shape Hollywood’s star system. The extremely low p-values confirm we’re not dealing with random cosmic dust here—these are deliberate alignments and misalignments.

# **Age Analysis of the Hollywood Movie Industry**

## **Introduction**

In my previous exploration, I noted ethnic imbalances. Now I pivot my telescopes to the dimension of age. By comparing the age distributions of male and female Hollywood actors to that of Earth’s baseline population, I hope to see if this powerhouse industry reflects natural age diversity or instead orbits around a narrow “golden age” interval—like a planet stuck in tidally locked youth.

---

## **Preliminary Plots: Actor vs. Real-World Age Distributions**

<!-- Dropdown ici -->

The differences are startling: while Earth’s population displays a uniform spread of ages, Hollywood places its spotlight firmly on youth, especially for female actors. This “golden age” glows conspicuously, sidelining older talents in favor of a youthful supernova.

  <!-- Text Container -->
  <div style="width: 40%; padding: 10px;">
    <p>

## **Statistical Toolkit and Metrics**

To measure these disparities, I deployed several Earthly statistical tools:

1. **Wasserstein Distance**: Measures how much “effort” it would take to reshape one distribution into another.  
2. **KL Divergence**: Gauges how “surprised” we should be if we treat one distribution as normal.  
3. **Gini Coefficient**: Quantifies inequality; 0 represents perfect equality, while 1 indicates total concentration in a single group or area.  
4. **Lorenz Curves**: Visual maps showing cumulative inequality.

## **Linking Results to Raw Distributions**

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: space-between;">
  
  <!-- Text Container -->
  <div style="flex: 1; padding: 10px;">
    <p>

### **Female Actors**  
Female actors cluster around ages 20–35, forming a radiant “golden age.” Past the mid-30s, female presence wanes drastically, unlike the more even real-world female age curve. High Gini and KL values confirm a rigid standard: Hollywood ties female marketability to youth, reinforcing stereotypes and sidelining older actresses.

  </p>
  </div>
  
  <!-- Plot Container -->
  <div style="flex: 1; padding: 10px;">
      <p>

### **Male Actors**  
Men too face a narrower age band, peaking in their 30s and early 40s, though not as sharply as women. Their curve still outshines the even spread of real-world males, showing Hollywood’s notion of a “prime” age for men as well—just slightly broader than the female window.

  </p>
  </div>
</div>


## **Interpretation and Conclusions**

These findings support what Earthly scholars like Dr. Stacy L. Smith and the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative have long documented: Hollywood’s casting biases favor youth, especially for women. The “golden age” phenomenon emerges again, forged by commercial logic, cultural expectations, and the gravitational pull of tradition.

This age skew appears as another cosmic puzzle piece. Just as ethnicity distribution was skewed, so too is age distribution. The patterns reflect a deep-rooted reluctance to embrace Earth’s full spectrum of maturity. By shining a light on these biases, perhaps the industry can one day distribute its spotlight more evenly across all ages.



---

# **Gender Comparative Analysis of the Hollywood Movie Industry**

## **Introduction**

Having investigated ethnicity and age, I now orbit gender. Earth’s male and female populations are roughly balanced, yet Hollywood’s gravitational field may tilt toward one gender in leading roles. By comparing genre-based gender proportions to real-world baselines, I hope to see if Hollywood aims for gender harmony or clings to old biases.

---

## **Preliminary Visualizations of Gender Representation**

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/20769488"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script><noscript><img src="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/20769488/thumbnail" width="100%" alt="chart visualization" /></noscript></div>



The visualization below shows how female representation in various genres changed from 1950 to 2012. Some genres may rise towards equilibrium, others may remain stuck in a more lopsided orbit.

---

## **Statistical Validation: Chi-Square and Friedman Tests**

To confirm these patterns aren’t just cosmic illusions:

<div style="display: flex; align-items: up; justify-content: space-between;">
  <!-- Text Container -->
  <div style="flex: 1; padding: 10px;">
    <p>

### **Friedman Test**

1. **Friedman Test for Consistency Over Time:**  
   Evaluates whether female representation trends move uniformly across genres. If not, it suggests shifting cultural tides affecting different genres differently.

  </p>
  </div>

  <!-- Plot Container -->
  <div style="flex: 1; padding: 10px;">
      <p>

### **Chi-Square Test**

2. **Chi-Square Test for Gender Proportions:**  
   Compares observed vs. expected gender frequencies. A tiny p-value spells significant differences.


  </p>
  </div>
</div>

<div style="display: flex; align-items: up; justify-content: space-between;">
  <!-- Text Container -->
  <div style="flex: 1; padding: 10px;">
    <p>


With a Friedman chi-square of ~42.49 and a p-value ~2.75e-05, I must conclude that female representation across genres does not remain stable. Some genres improve, others stagnate or even regress over the decades. This temporal variability indicates that shifts in cultural attitudes, policies, or audience demands shape who appears on screen.

  </p>
  </div>

  <!-- Plot Container -->
  <div style="flex: 1; padding: 10px;">
      <p>

A chi-square statistic of ~213.55 and p-value ~2.3e-48 confirms that Hollywood’s gender ratios do not match Earth’s baseline. One gender is consistently favored.

  </p>
  </div>
</div>

---

## **Ranking of Genres by Female Proportion**

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-bar-chart-race" data-src="visualisation/20791376"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script><noscript><img src="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/20791376/thumbnail" width="100%" alt="bar-chart-race visualization" /></noscript></div>

Romance leads the female presence race, while Action/Adventure and Documentary cling to male-dominant scripts, forging gender imbalances into their narrative DNA.

## **Interpretation and Conclusions**

Across ethnicity, age, and now gender, Hollywood’s patterns form a familiar constellation of bias. Women appear underrepresented, and their visibility swings unpredictably with time and genre. Once again, this echoes the “golden age” concept—Hollywood confines actresses to a youthful prime and restricts their appearance by genre.

Historical studies, like Lauzen’s *The Celluloid Ceiling*, consistently confirm these patterns. Add age-related biases, and you have a constellation of inequalities that Earth’s activists, scholars, and industry reformers have struggled to realign.

---

### **Linking Back to Visual and Historical Observations**

Time-based graphs show that some genres respond to shifts in cultural awareness while others resist or lag behind. This ranking and variability suggest that the future of gender parity in Hollywood is still being forged in the fires of shifting tastes, advocacy, and policy changes.

# **The Rise of Crime and Crime-Themed Movies**

Given the United States’ position as a world leader in mass incarceration, I decided to delve deeper and analyze how real-world crime compares to what is portrayed on screen. By examining the prevalence and evolution of crime movies, we can uncover the resonance between Hollywood’s narratives.


**Why Analyze Crime Movies?**  
Crime movies serve as cultural indicators, reflecting societal fears, moral dilemmas, and shifting political climates. By tracing their prevalence through Hollywood’s timeline, we gain insight into evolving human struggles and the timeless fascination with stories where order collides with chaos.

---


The visualization below shows the changing prevalence of crime-themed movies over time, with each rise and fall reflecting shifts in cultural concerns, industry dynamics, and evolving public interests.



<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: space-between;">
  
  <div style="flex: 1; padding: 10px;">

  </div>

</div>


---

## **Real-World Connection: The Incarceration Boom**

These trends align with some unsettling real-world patterns. Since 1980, the U.S. incarceration rate has quadrupled, a dramatic rise that coincides with Hollywood’s growing focus on crime-related movies. This raises compelling questions: Are these films reflecting societal fears tied to the rapid expansion of the prison population and intensified law enforcement efforts? Or are they, in some way, shaping public perceptions about justice, crime, and punishment?

### **Conclusion**

As my exploration of Hollywood concludes, clear patterns emerge. Whether analyzing ethnicity, age, gender, or crime narratives, the data reveal persistent imbalances—marginalized groups, a focus on youth, and an enduring fascination with crime. These trends are shaped by historical legacies, cultural norms, and economic priorities, echoing societal realities.

Yet, change is always possible. By recognizing these biases, Hollywood has the chance to broaden its lens and reflect a more complex and diverse world. With thoughtful storytelling, cinema could evolve into a true mirror of Earth’s vast and varied experiences.

# Integrated Analysis of Cinematic Representation Gaps and Box Office Revenue

---

# Introduction

As I drifted among Earth’s cultural constellations, I ventured into a grand endeavor: to understand how the movies Earthlings cherish align—or misalign—with the demographic patterns of your own reality. Anchored in three key metrics—**Ethnicity**, **Age**, and **Gender**—I sought to quantify representation gaps between real-world populations and the actors who grace Earthlings' screens. By examining how these discrepancies evolved through time and across regions, and by linking them to the gravitational pull of box office revenue, I hoped to uncover whether economic currents encourage such imbalances.

To explore this cinematic cosmos, I employed multiple observational instruments and analytical methods:

1. **Radial Tree Plot**: A visual galaxy mapping how movie success categories (Highly Successful, Successful, Normal) link to various genres and regions.  
2. **Combination Dual-Axis Charts**: Temporal journeys tracking representation gaps and box office revenue across decades, regions, and metrics. These help us see if changes in gaps mirror changes in revenue.  
3. **Sankey Plots**: Flows of movies from representation gap intervals to genres and ultimately to success categories, aggregated over the entire 1950–2012 period. These highlight structural associations between gap magnitude, genre choice, and final revenue outcomes.  
4. **Linear Regression Analyses**: Statistical attempts to measure a direct relationship between representation gaps and box office performance, both in simple forms (just gap vs. revenue) and more complex forms (controlling for metric type and temporal batches).

Armed with these tools, I can piece together a narrative: Does the industry’s portrayal of different ethnicities, genders, and ages shape—or is shaped by—its economic incentives?

---

# Methodology Adopted

**Representation Gaps**:  
For each metric (Ethnicity, Age, Gender), I computed representation gaps as absolute percentage differences between the movie populations and the corresponding real-world demographic proportions. The larger the gap, the further the industry strayed from mirroring Earth’s demographic reality. These gaps were calculated for each region (Hollywood, Bollywood, East Asia, Europe), across multiple 10-year time batches (1950–1959, 1960–1969, …, 2010–2012).

**Box Office Revenue**:  
To assess economic outcomes, I examined aggregated box office revenues (mean per batch or overall distributions) and categorized movies into percentile-based success categories:  
- **Highly Successful**: Top 10% by revenue  
- **Successful**: 40th to 90th percentile  
- **Normal**: Below the 40th percentile

By pairing these success categories with representation gaps, I hoped to see if achieving higher revenues demanded certain demographic imbalances.

**Same Metrics as Before**:  
I consistently used the same age, gender, and ethnicity data, ensuring coherence with previous analyses. Through all these steps—radial plots, line/area charts, Sankey diagrams, and regressions—the fundamental metrics and methods remained stable, allowing a comprehensive cross-check.

---

# The Four Analytical Works

## 1. Radial Tree Plot

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-hierarchy" data-src="visualisation/20820914"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script><noscript><img src="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/20820914/thumbnail" width="100%" alt="hierarchy visualization" /></noscript></div>

This plot arranges genres around a circular axis, with success categories branching outward. Across all regions or within each one, we see how different genres populate these success tiers.

**Key Insights**:  
- **Global Patterns**: Action/Adventure and mass-appeal genres often cluster in Highly Successful tiers, indicating that big-budget spectacle transcends cultural borders. Documentaries and more niche genres hover in the Successful or Normal zones, mirroring their limited commercial appeal.  
- **Regional Nuances**: Hollywood’s penchant for Action/Adventure and Sci-Fi dominates the top revenue stratum, Bollywood’s Romance/Drama tradition finds consistent but not always top-tier success, East Asia’s Thriller/Suspense or locally favored genres anchor their success tiers, and Europe’s arthouse tilt shows fewer blockbuster hits.  
- **Link to Representation Gaps**: Although the radial tree plot does not directly show demographic gaps, it complements previous findings. Genres historically associated with skewed demographics still rank highly, suggesting that economic success often aligns with entrenched formulas, regardless of representational parity.

By showing the final distribution of genres into success categories, the radial chart reveals that commercial viability is often genre-driven and shaped by longstanding cultural and industrial norms—not necessarily by aligning closely with real-world demographics.

## 2. Combination Dual-Axis Charts: Hollywood

<!-- Dropdown pour chaque région ici-->

These charts overlay representation gaps and box office revenue over the decades, providing a temporal lens. For each region and metric, we see how gaps and revenue evolve together or diverge.

**Key Insights**:  
- **No Universal Trend**: Some periods show growing representation gaps alongside rising box office, others show shrinking gaps paired with stable revenue. This variation undermines any simple causal narrative.  
- **Cultural and Historical Context**: Hollywood’s shifts might reflect the blockbuster era, the influence of social movements, or global expansion. Bollywood’s stable star system could make representation gaps economically irrelevant. East Asia’s homogeneity might keep high gaps stable without penalty. Europe’s arthouse markets don’t necessarily reward more balanced demographics with big commercial wins.  
- **Societal Phenomena**: Periods of civil rights activism or global cultural exchange might nudge representation toward slightly narrower gaps without harming box office returns. Nonetheless, the data shows no strong pattern of “more representative = more revenue” or “less representative = more revenue.” Instead, genre cycles, star vehicles, and distribution networks overshadow demographic fine-tuning.

By capturing changes over decades, these combination dual-axis charts illustrate that economic success is molded by historical forces and market evolutions rather than a direct or stable representation-gap-to-revenue pipeline.

---

## 3. Representation Gaps and Box Office Revenue Impact: Hollywood 

<!-- Dropdown pour chaque région ici-->


The Sankey diagrams show the different flows of movies from representation gap intervals to genres and then to success categories. This tri-level mapping helps identify structural patterns.

**Key Insights**:  
- **Large Gap Intervals Still Yield Success**: If flows from high-gap categories ([50,75] or even [75,100]) lead into popular genres and ultimately into Highly Successful categories, it implies that entrenched demographic imbalances did not prevent lucrative outcomes.  
- **Genre as an Economic Mediator**: Some genres consistently channel movies into Successful or even Highly Successful tiers, regardless of gap size. This supports the idea that genre preferences and star power might be more influential than demographic realism.  
- **Comparing Metrics and Regions**: In Hollywood, large-gap intervals feeding into Action/Adventure and then into Highly Successful categories confirm that commercial formulas, not representational accuracy, often drive profit. Bollywood’s stable success of Romance/Drama under large gaps indicates similarly entrenched formulas. East Asia and Europe show analogous patterns, each with their local twists.

The Sankey plots, by exposing stable “flows” from gap categories to success categories, reinforce the notion that representation gap levels are not strong determinants of economic fate. Instead, the industry’s gravitational fields—rooted in genre traditions and audience tastes—predominantly shape financial success.

## 4. Linear Regression Analyses



After visually exploring patterns, I turned to linear and multiple regressions to seek a statistical relationship between representation gap and box office.

<!-- Dropdown pour chaque région ici-->

<iframe src="/assets/plots/box-office/regression_plot_Hollywood.html" width="100%" height="400px" style="border:none;"></iframe>

**Key Insights**:  
- **Simple Regression Weakness**: Only Hollywood’s simple regression suggested a modest negative relationship (higher gap = slightly lower revenue), but even that was weak.  
- **Multiple Regression Overfitting**: Controlling for Metric and 10-year Batch labels explained all variation, leaving Representation Gap insignificant. This implies time and categorical differences, not demographic alignment, dominate the statistical landscape.  
- **Across Regions**: Bollywood, East Asia, and Europe showed no meaningful linear association between gap and revenue. The complex interplay of cultural history, market size, and genre preference overwhelms any direct linear effect of representation gaps.

These regressions confirm that once we factor in historical context (time periods) and differing metrics (ethnicity, age, gender), representation gap ceases to matter statistically. This supports the broader narrative: no simple numeric gap measure can predict box office returns reliably.

# Bringing It All Together

Across four distinct works, one message emerges: **economic success in cinema does not strongly hinge on how closely movie demographics match real-world populations.**

- **Radial Tree Plot**: Shows that globally favored genres secure top-tier revenue regardless of representational fidelity, hinting that economic incentives didn’t enforce representational balance.  
- **Combination Dual-Axis Charts**: Demonstrate that representation gaps fluctuate with historical forces, yet these fluctuations do not consistently correlate with higher or lower box office revenues. The industry’s formulas and cultural shifts matter more.  
- **Sankey Plots**: Aggregated flows reveal that even large demographic imbalances often feed into highly successful tiers via certain lucrative genres, reinforcing the idea that entrenched production norms hold sway over economic outcomes.  
- **Linear Regression Analysis**: Statistically confirms that once historical eras and metric categories are considered, representation gap loses explanatory power. No straightforward causal or linear link emerges between gap and revenue.

**Contextualizing with Societal and Historical Research**:  
Earth's real-world scholarship, from the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative’s studies on representation to historical accounts of Hollywood’s studio system, corroborate these patterns. Social movements for diversity have nudged changes, but the box office bottom line seems driven more by star systems, blockbuster formulas, and marketing prowess than by demographic accuracy. Bollywood’s reliance on established stars and romance genres, East Asia’s local genre preferences, and Europe’s arthouse identity all reflect entrenched market conditions rather than demographic rectifications.

**Conclusion**:  
My cosmic exploration suggests that, while moral and cultural arguments for better representation are robust and well-documented, purely economic motives don’t straightforwardly reward or punish representational fidelity. Cinematic ecosystems seem able to thrive financially under various demographic distributions, relying instead on traditional genres, star legacies, and shifting audience tastes. To alter these constellations of representation, external sociopolitical forces, audience advocacy, and institutional reforms may be required—beyond the gravitational pull of the box office itself.

In sum, the works we assembled act like telescopes and spectrometers. They reveal a complex cinematic universe where demographic reality often bends under the weight of tradition, cultural myths, and economic expediency. True demographic alignment might not guarantee a bigger cosmic payoff, but the pursuit of a cinema that mirrors its audience’s diversity might still resonate with Earth’s evolving sense of justice and authenticity.

**More insights on Data Reliability Score:**

The **Reliability Score 𝑅** is calculated as:

#### **R\=0.4⋅D+0.4⋅(1−M)+0.2⋅T** 

With:
**D = Dataset Size Ratio.**
**M = Missing Data Ratio.** 
**𝑇 = Temporal Coverage ratio.**

Ensuring that:
- Higher missing data decreases the score.
- A region with balanced dataset size and temporal coverage will achieve higher scores.
