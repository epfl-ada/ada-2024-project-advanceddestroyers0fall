# Welcome to My Draft Post

This is a **draft** post. Drafts are great for when you're still working on content and don't want to publish it yet.

## Benefits of Using Drafts

- Allows you to work on content without making it live.
- Ensures your site doesn't have incomplete or rough content visible to visitors.
- Drafts can be previewed locally before publishing.

## How to Preview Drafts in Jekyll

You can preview this draft post by running:

```bash
jekyll serve --drafts
